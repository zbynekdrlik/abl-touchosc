## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: ATTEMPTED fixes for meter and fader issues
- [ ] Waiting for: User to TEST if fixes work
- [ ] Blocked by: Need test results - NOTHING IS CONFIRMED WORKING

## Current Status (2025-07-04 18:58 UTC)

### ⚠️ PHASE 1 BUG FIXES ATTEMPTED - NOT TESTED!

**Fixes ATTEMPTED (NOT CONFIRMED WORKING):**
1. **Meter Not Working (v2.5.9)** ❓ UNTESTED
   - Problem found: Meter tried to get connection index before parent initialized
   - Fix attempted: Deferred connection setup until track info available
   - Status: **NOT TESTED - MAY STILL BE BROKEN**
   
2. **Fader Jumpy Animation (v2.7.1)** ❓ UNTESTED
   - Problem found: Double-tap animation jumpy due to 10Hz update rate
   - Fix attempted: Increased update rate to 60Hz
   - Status: **NOT TESTED - MAY STILL BE JUMPY**
   
3. **Verbose Logging** ❓ UNRESOLVED
   - Problem: Version logs show even with DEBUG=0
   - Cause: Using `print()` not debug statements
   - Status: **NO FIX APPLIED - STILL VERBOSE**

### VERSION TRACKING - CHANGES MADE BUT NOT TESTED

### NOTHING IS CONFIRMED WORKING!
**DO NOT ASSUME ANY FIXES WORK WITHOUT TEST LOGS**

### TESTING REQUIRED:
- [ ] Does meter display ANY levels?
- [ ] Does meter status indicator change color AT ALL?
- [ ] Is fader double-tap animation smooth or still jumpy?
- [ ] Are there new bugs introduced?
- [ ] Are logs still verbose?

### USER'S LAST TEST RESULTS (18:33 UTC):
- ❌ Meter not working at all, no color changes
- ❌ Fader animation jumpy/not fluent  
- ❌ Logs still verbose even with DEBUG=0

### CHANGES MADE SINCE LAST TEST:
1. meter_script.lua v2.5.9 - attempted connection timing fix
2. fader_script.lua v2.7.1 - changed update rate to 60Hz
3. NO fix for verbose logging yet

### NEXT STEPS:
1. **USER MUST TEST ALL CHANGES**
2. **PROVIDE TEST LOGS SHOWING SUCCESS OR FAILURE**
3. **DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT CONFIRMATION**
