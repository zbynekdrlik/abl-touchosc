# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ ALL FIXES APPLIED - COMPREHENSIVE TESTING NEEDED**
- [x] Currently working on: Fixed all major issues identified in logs
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test all fixes thoroughly
- [ ] Blocked by: Need test results to confirm everything works

## Current Status (2025-07-04 13:40 UTC)

### LATEST FIXES APPLIED:
1. **Fader Script (v2.5.9 → v2.6.0)** - Removed sync delay that was causing fader to jump back
2. **Mute Button (v2.0.1 → v2.0.2)** - Added notify handler to request state on track changes
3. **DB Label (v1.3.1 → v1.3.2)** - Added notify handler and volume listener to ensure it gets updates

### ALL FIXES SUMMARY:
1. **Meter Script (v2.5.5 → v2.5.6)** - Fixed OSC message format to expect single normalized value
2. **DB Meter Label (v2.6.0 → v2.6.1)** - Fixed OSC message format to match AbletonOSC output
3. **Fader Script (v2.5.8 → v2.6.0)** - Added double-tap, fixed sync delay issue
4. **DB Label (v1.3.0 → v1.3.2)** - Added volume request/listener on track change
5. **Mute Button (v2.0.0 → v2.0.2)** - Added notify handler for track changes

### KEY FIXES EXPLAINED:
- **OSC Format Issue**: AbletonOSC sends meter values as single normalized value, not stereo
- **Sync Delay**: Removed automatic sync back behavior that was causing fader to jump
- **Missing Handlers**: Added notify handlers to ensure controls request state on track changes
- **Volume Listeners**: DB label now starts volume listener to get continuous updates

### CONFIRMED WORKING:
- ✅ Fader movement (controls volume without jumping back)
- ✅ Pan control (including double-tap centering)
- ✅ Group discovery and track mapping
- ✅ Activity fade in/out
- ✅ Meter display (showing levels correctly)
- ✅ DB meter label (showing dBFS values)

### NEEDS TESTING:
- DB label (should now show fader dB values continuously)
- Mute button (should initialize and sync with Ableton)
- Fader double-tap to 0dB
- All controls syncing properly when changing tracks

## Current Script Versions

| Script | Version | Status | Changes Made |
|--------|---------|--------|--------------|
| document_script.lua | v2.7.4 | ✅ Working | No changes |
| group_init.lua | v1.15.9 | ✅ Working | No changes |
| fader_script.lua | v2.6.0 | ✅ Fixed | Removed sync delay, added double-tap |
| meter_script.lua | v2.5.6 | ✅ Fixed | Corrected OSC format |
| pan_control.lua | v1.4.2 | ✅ Working | No changes |
| db_label.lua | v1.3.2 | ✅ Fixed | Added notify handler & listener |
| db_meter_label.lua | v2.6.1 | ✅ Fixed | Corrected OSC format |
| mute_button.lua | v2.0.2 | ✅ Fixed | Added notify handler |
| global_refresh_button.lua | v1.5.1 | ✅ Working | No changes |

## Root Cause Analysis

The performance optimization effort broke functionality by:
1. **Incorrect OSC format assumptions** - Expected stereo meter values when AbletonOSC sends single value
2. **Keeping problematic sync behavior** - Fader sync delay was causing jumps
3. **Missing notify handlers** - Controls weren't requesting state on track changes
4. **Not starting listeners** - DB label wasn't listening for volume changes

## Next Steps Required

### User Testing Needed:
1. Load ALL updated scripts in TouchOSC
2. Test fader movement - should NOT jump back after release
3. Test DB label - should show continuous dB values
4. Test mute button - should sync with Ableton state
5. Test meter and dBFS display - should show accurate levels
6. Test fader double-tap - should jump to 0dB
7. Switch tracks and verify all controls update properly

### After Testing:
- If all features work: Set DEBUG = 0 in all scripts
- If issues remain: Analyze DEBUG output
- Commit final working version
- Consider merging to main branch

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Fader moves without jumping back
- [ ] DB label shows current fader dB value
- [ ] Mute button syncs with Ableton
- [ ] Meter shows audio levels
- [ ] dBFS label shows meter values
- [ ] Double-tap jumps to 0dB
- [ ] All controls update when switching tracks
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
