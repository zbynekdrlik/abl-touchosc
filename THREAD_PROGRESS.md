# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Added state queries to fix mute/volume/pan reset issue
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test BOTH fixes on Android tablet
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Android tablet fix - MINIMAL VERSION WITH STATE QUERIES
- Step: Applied race condition fix + state query fix
- Status: IMPLEMENTED - NEEDS TESTING

## The Fixes Applied
1. **Race Condition Fix (v1.17.1)**:
   - Added `processedRegularTracks` and `processedReturnTracks` flags
   - Prevents "Track not found" errors when track names arrive at different times

2. **State Reset Fix (v1.17.2)** - NEW CRITICAL FIX:
   - Added state queries after successful mapping
   - Queries volume, mute, and panning after starting listeners
   - Prevents controls resetting to default values on refresh

## Testing Required
1. Test on Android tablet with return tracks visible
2. Verify tracks map correctly (green indicators)
3. Confirm no "not found" errors in logs
4. **NEW**: Verify mute/volume/pan states are preserved after refresh
5. Test refresh button works reliably

## Next Steps After Testing
If both fixes work:
1. Merge PR #29 (this minimal fix)
2. Close PR #28 (contains unnecessary changes)
3. Merge PR #24 (double-click mute feature)
4. Create v1.5.0 release

If issues persist:
- Use the backup branch (fix/android-tablet-refresh-timing) for deeper analysis
- The backup branch has extensive logging enabled
