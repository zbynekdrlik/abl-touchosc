## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Double-click mute feature implementation
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing and feedback
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION
- Step: Implementation complete, ready for testing
- Status: TESTING
- Branch: feature/double-click-mute
- PR: #24 (open)

## Feature Requirements
User requested: "mute/unmute over double click to prevent unwanted mute/unmute on critical tracks"
- ✅ Configurable via configuration object
- ✅ Specific group faders can be configured for double-click behavior
- ✅ Other tracks maintain single-click behavior (backward compatible)

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| mute_button.lua | ✅ v2.2.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| document_script.lua | ✅ v2.9.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| README.md | ✅ updated | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| CHANGELOG.md | ✅ updated | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-06
- Action: Requested double-click mute feature
- Result: Feature implemented
- Next Required: Test the implementation

## Implementation Complete
1. ✅ Created feature branch
2. ✅ Updated THREAD_PROGRESS.md
3. ✅ Modified mute_button.lua to add double-click detection
4. ✅ Updated document_script.lua to v2.9.0 (documentation updates)
5. ✅ Updated README.md with feature documentation
6. ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md
7. ✅ Created PR #24

## Configuration Format
```yaml
# Double-click mute configuration
# Format: double_click_mute_[instance]: 'GroupName'
double_click_mute_band: 'Band Tracks'
double_click_mute_dj: 'Master Bus'
double_click_mute: 'Critical Group'  # All instances
```

## How It Works
- Groups configured for double-click require two clicks within 500ms
- First click is recorded, second click within threshold triggers mute toggle
- Groups without configuration use single-click (backward compatible)
- Configuration is read directly by mute_button.lua

## Testing Needed
1. Single-click behavior on non-configured tracks
2. Double-click detection on configured tracks
3. Configuration parsing with various formats
4. Multiple instances with different configurations
5. Edge cases (triple-click, timing boundaries)

## Next Steps
- User needs to test the implementation
- Verify configuration works as expected
- Check timing feels natural (500ms threshold)
- Confirm no regression on existing functionality
