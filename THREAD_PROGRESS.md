# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: REMOVED ALL CENTRALIZED LOGGING
- [ ] Waiting for: Testing of changes (db_meter_label v2.9.0, document_script v2.8.0)
- [ ] Blocked by: None
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: NO CENTRALIZED LOGGING - Each script handles its own!

## Current Status (2025-07-04 21:41 UTC)

### ‚úÖ MAJOR FIX COMPLETED: REMOVED ALL CENTRALIZED LOGGING

**What was wrong:**
- I misunderstood and tried to implement centralized logging
- This was OPPOSITE of the goal of this performance branch!

**What was fixed:**
1. **db_meter_label.lua v2.9.0** 
   - Removed ALL centralized logging
   - Removed value_changed fallback
   - Each script prints its own logs

2. **document_script.lua v2.8.0**
   - Removed ALL log_message handling
   - Removed logger functionality
   - Now handles configuration ONLY

3. **TouchOSC rules updated**
   - Rule #11 now clearly states NO CENTRALIZED LOGGING
   - Added multiple warnings and examples
   - Made it crystal clear for future sessions

### üö® CRITICAL PRINCIPLE FOR THIS BRANCH:

**NO CENTRALIZED LOGGING WHATSOEVER:**
- NO log_message notify
- NO logger text object
- NO centralized logger
- Each script prints to console directly
- This is for PERFORMANCE - no notification overhead!

### üìù SCRIPTS STILL TO UPDATE:

All other scripts need to be checked for:
- [ ] Remove any `root:notify("log_message", ...)` calls
- [ ] Update to direct console logging
- [ ] Verify DEBUG flag controls logging

Scripts to check:
- [ ] fader_script.lua
- [ ] meter_script.lua  
- [ ] mute_button.lua
- [ ] pan_control.lua
- [ ] db_label.lua
- [ ] group_init.lua
- [ ] global_refresh_button.lua

### ‚úÖ NOTIFY USAGE (All others are OK):

After review, these notify uses are NEEDED and correct:
- `track_changed` - Essential for child coordination
- `track_type` - Essential for OSC path selection
- `track_unmapped` - Essential for state management
- `child_touched/released` - UI interactions
- `sibling_touched/released` - UI coordination
- `refresh_all_groups` - One-time initialization

### NEXT STEPS:
1. Test the updated scripts (v2.9.0 and v2.8.0)
2. Update remaining scripts to remove centralized logging
3. Verify all scripts use direct console logging
4. Update CHANGELOG.md with these changes
