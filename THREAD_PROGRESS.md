## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ FEEDBACK LOOP FIX CREATED - READY FOR TESTING:**
- [x] Issue identified: Feedback loop when moving faders in Ableton
- [x] Root cause: TouchOSC sending OSC back when receiving updates from Ableton
- [x] Fix implemented: Added updating_from_osc flag in fader_script.lua v2.5.4
- [ ] Next step: Test the feedback loop fix in TouchOSC

## Implementation Status
- Phase: FEEDBACK LOOP FIX IMPLEMENTED
- Status: READY FOR TESTING
- Branch: feature/track-8-10-mismatch
- AbletonOSC PR: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC/pull/3

## Latest Fix: Feedback Loop Prevention (v2.5.4)
**Issue:** When moving fader in Ableton:
1. Ableton sends OSC to TouchOSC to update fader position
2. TouchOSC receives and updates its fader (self.values.x)
3. This triggers onValueChanged() which sends OSC back to Ableton
4. Creates feedback loop making Ableton fader jumpy/laggy

**Solution:** Added `updating_from_osc` flag to prevent sending OSC when updating from received OSC:
- Set flag before updating self.values.x in onReceiveOSC()
- Check flag in onValueChanged() and skip sending if set
- Also set flag in update() function during sync operations

## Testing Instructions for Feedback Loop Fix
1. Update fader_script.lua in TouchOSC (v2.5.4)
2. Restart TouchOSC
3. Test fader movements:
   - Move fader in Ableton → TouchOSC fader should follow smoothly
   - No jumpy/laggy behavior in Ableton
   - Move fader in TouchOSC → Ableton should update normally
   - Bidirectional sync should work without feedback

## Previous Fixes Created in AbletonOSC
1. **Fixed String/Bytes Error** (osc_server.py)
   - Fixed "write() argument must be str, not bytes" error
   - Added proper decoding when writing debug data

2. **Fixed Listener Cross-Wiring** (track.py & handler.py)
   - Added thread-safe listener registration with locks
   - Fixed track index validation to prevent out-of-bounds
   - Improved error handling in callbacks  
   - Ensured correct track indices are always sent

3. **Fixed Observer Errors**
   - Added clear_api method to safely remove all listeners
   - Improved listener cleanup on shutdown

## Testing Instructions for AbletonOSC
1. Copy the fixed files from AbletonOSC fork to your Ableton installation:
   - abletonosc/osc_server.py
   - abletonosc/handler.py
   - abletonosc/track.py
2. Restart Ableton Live
3. Test all track volume changes (0-11)
4. Verify Track 5 only updates Track 5
5. Verify Track 8 responds as Track 8 (not 10)
6. Check for any errors in Ableton logs

## Issue Analysis
User logs showed clear evidence of AbletonOSC listener cross-wiring:

**Track 5 broadcasting to multiple tracks:**
```
SEND: /live/track/set/volume FLOAT(5) FLOAT(0.7755736)
RECEIVE: /live/track/get/volume FLOAT(5) FLOAT(0.7755736)
RECEIVE: /live/track/get/volume FLOAT(6) FLOAT(0.7755736)
RECEIVE: /live/track/get/volume FLOAT(7) FLOAT(0.7755736)
```

**Track 8 receiving as track 10:**
```
SEND: /live/track/set/volume FLOAT(8) FLOAT(0.7574361)
RECEIVE: /live/track/get/volume FLOAT(10) FLOAT(0.7574361)
```

## Key Findings
1. This is NOT a TouchOSC issue
2. The problem was in AbletonOSC's listener registration/routing
3. Return track support implementation introduced bugs
4. Fixed with proper thread safety and validation
5. Feedback loop was a separate issue in TouchOSC (now fixed)
