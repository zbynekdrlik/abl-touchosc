# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ ABLETONOSC FIXES CREATED - READY FOR TESTING:**
- [x] Issue identified: Multiple tracks receiving same listener events  
- [x] Pattern found: Track 5 broadcasts to tracks 5,6,7; Track 8 responds as track 10
- [x] Root cause: AbletonOSC listener system bug (not TouchOSC issue)
- [x] Fork AbletonOSC: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC
- [x] Created fixes in branch: fix/listener-cross-wiring
- [ ] Next step: Test the fixes in Ableton

## Implementation Status
- Phase: FIXES IMPLEMENTED
- Status: READY FOR TESTING
- Branch: feature/track-8-10-mismatch
- AbletonOSC PR: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC/pull/3

## Fixes Created in AbletonOSC
1. **Fixed String/Bytes Error** (osc_server.py)
   - Fixed "write() argument must be str, not bytes" error
   - Added proper decoding when writing debug data

2. **Fixed Listener Cross-Wiring** (track.py & handler.py)
   - Added thread-safe listener registration with locks
   - Fixed track index validation to prevent out-of-bounds
   - Improved error handling in callbacks  
   - Ensured correct track indices are always sent

3. **Fixed Observer Errors**
   - Added clear_api method to safely remove all listeners
   - Improved listener cleanup on shutdown

## Testing Instructions
1. Copy the fixed files from AbletonOSC fork to your Ableton installation:
   - abletonosc/osc_server.py
   - abletonosc/handler.py
   - abletonosc/track.py
2. Restart Ableton Live
3. Test all track volume changes (0-11)
4. Verify Track 5 only updates Track 5
5. Verify Track 8 responds as Track 8 (not 10)
6. Check for any errors in Ableton logs

## Issue Analysis
User logs showed clear evidence of AbletonOSC listener cross-wiring:

**Track 5 broadcasting to multiple tracks:**
```
SEND: /live/track/set/volume FLOAT(5) FLOAT(0.7755736)
RECEIVE: /live/track/get/volume FLOAT(5) FLOAT(0.7755736)
RECEIVE: /live/track/get/volume FLOAT(6) FLOAT(0.7755736)
RECEIVE: /live/track/get/volume FLOAT(7) FLOAT(0.7755736)
```

**Track 8 receiving as track 10:**
```
SEND: /live/track/set/volume FLOAT(8) FLOAT(0.7574361)
RECEIVE: /live/track/get/volume FLOAT(10) FLOAT(0.7574361)
```

## Key Findings
1. This is NOT a TouchOSC issue
2. The problem was in AbletonOSC's listener registration/routing
3. Return track support implementation introduced bugs
4. Fixed with proper thread safety and validation
