# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Interactive mute label script WORKING (v2.8.6)
- [x] Touch detection fixed - using `values.touch` not `values.x`
- [x] Double-click protection functional
- [x] ⚠ warning symbol displays correctly
- [x] Unmuted color changed to orange (#F39420) - v2.8.6
- [ ] Need to test with non-protected groups
- [ ] Consider touch reaction improvements

## WORKING VERSION: v2.8.6
### What's Working:
- ✅ Touch detection on interactive labels
- ✅ Double-click requirement for protected groups
- ✅ Single-click for non-protected groups
- ✅ OSC messages sent correctly
- ✅ Mute state toggles properly
- ✅ ⚠ warning symbol shows for protected groups
- ✅ Text updates (MUTE/MUTED)
- ✅ Orange background (#F39420) when unmuted

### Known Issues/Improvements Needed:
1. **Color Scheme**:
   - Current: Dark red (muted) / Orange (unmuted)
   - Yellow flash on click (100ms)
   - Test visibility and contrast
   - Verify colors work well in different lighting

2. **Touch Feedback**:
   - Multiple touch events fired per click (seen in logs)
   - May need to filter for `touch == true` only
   - Consider debouncing or better touch handling

3. **Visual Polish**:
   - Test if ⚠ symbol is clearly visible
   - Verify background colors work well
   - Check text readability with background colors
   - Consider size/position of warning symbol

4. **Testing Needed**:
   - Test with groups NOT in double-click list
   - Test with multiple instances
   - Test with regular tracks (not just returns)
   - Verify no regression in functionality
   - Test on actual device (not just editor)

## CODE STATUS
### Files Created/Modified:
- `/scripts/track/mute_label.lua` (v2.8.6) - WORKING
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Updated with v2.8.0 notes
- PR #24 - Updated with current status

### Key Code Insights:
```lua
-- Interactive labels use 'touch' value, not 'x'
if valueName == "touch" and self.values.touch == true then

-- Label properties that work:
self.interactive = true  -- Makes label clickable
self.background = true   -- Enables background color
self.values.text = "text"  -- Sets display text
self.color = Color(r,g,b,a)  -- Background color
```

## CONFIGURATION FORMAT
```yaml
# Working format for double-click protection:
double_click_mute: 'master_A-ReproM'
double_click_mute: 'band_Drums' 
double_click_mute: 'dj_Master Bus'
```

## NEXT THREAD TASKS
1. **Immediate Testing**:
   - [ ] Test single-click on non-protected groups
   - [ ] Verify visual feedback is visible enough
   - [ ] Check performance with multiple labels

2. **Touch Handling Improvements**:
   - [ ] Filter touch events to only react to `touch == true`
   - [ ] Prevent multiple events per single touch
   - [ ] Consider adding touch release handling

3. **Visual Refinements**:
   - [ ] Test orange/red color scheme visibility
   - [ ] Test ⚠ symbol size and positioning
   - [ ] Consider animation or fade effects
   - [ ] Match existing template aesthetic

4. **Code Cleanup**:
   - [ ] Remove debug logging (set DEBUG = 0)
   - [ ] Add comments for touch handling
   - [ ] Consider code optimization

5. **Documentation**:
   - [ ] Update README with new control type
   - [ ] Document interactive label setup
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting section

## TEMPLATE UPDATE REQUIREMENTS
To use the new interactive mute label:
1. Replace button controls with label controls
2. Set labels to interactive mode
3. Apply `mute_label.lua` script
4. Remove old separate display labels
5. Test thoroughly before deployment

## VERSION HISTORY
- v2.4.0 - Initial double-click for buttons
- v2.7.0 - Simplified config, button version complete
- v2.8.0 - First interactive label attempt
- v2.8.1 - Fixed function ordering
- v2.8.2 - Added debug logging
- v2.8.3 - Fixed userdata iteration
- v2.8.4 - Removed pcall usage
- v2.8.5 - Fixed touch detection
- v2.8.6 - **CURRENT** - Changed unmuted color to orange (#F39420)

## IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES
1. Interactive labels use `values.touch` not `values.x`
2. TouchOSC doesn't have `pcall` function
3. `self.values` is userdata, not a regular table
4. Multiple touch events fire per click (needs handling)
5. Label type is 2 (for reference)

## DEBUG LOG SNIPPETS
```
Working click sequence:
[12:34:17] onValueChanged called with valueName: touch
[12:34:17] Label touched!
[12:34:17] First click recorded, waiting for double-click
[12:34:18] onValueChanged called with valueName: touch
[12:34:20] onValueChanged called with valueName: touch
[12:34:20] Label touched!
[12:34:20] Double-click detected, toggling mute
```

## CRITICAL NOTES FOR NEXT THREAD
- Script IS WORKING but needs polish
- Main issue was touch vs x value confusion
- Multiple touch events per click may need addressing
- Visual feedback works but could be improved
- Remember to test with DEBUG = 0 in production
- Orange color (#F39420) now used for unmuted state
