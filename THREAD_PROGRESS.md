## Current Task: Fix Refresh All Track Renumbering
**Started**: 2025-07-05
**Branch**: fix/refresh-track-renumbering
**Status**: CODE_COMPLETE (v2)
**PR**: #14 updated

### Problem:
When inserting a new track at the beginning in Ableton Live, all tracks get renumbered (track 0 becomes track 1, etc.). The refresh all button doesn't properly reassign groups to the correct track numbers, causing faders to control the wrong tracks.

### Root Cause Found:
The groups were changing their `tag` property from "trackGroup" to "instance:trackNumber:trackType" after mapping. When refresh was triggered, it searched for groups with tag="trackGroup" but found 0 groups because they had all changed their tags.

### Solution Implemented (v2):
1. **document_script.lua v2.8.3**:
   - Added refresh sequencing with delay between clear and refresh
   - Send global stop_listen commands to ensure clean state
   - Use state machine for proper sequencing

2. **group_init.lua v1.16.2**:
   - **CRITICAL FIX**: Keep tag as "trackGroup" always
   - Store mapping info in separate `mappingInfo` property
   - This allows refresh to find groups by their original tag
   - Added `getTrackInfo()` function for children

3. **fader_script.lua v2.5.3**:
   - Updated to use parent's `getTrackInfo()` method
   - Support new mappingInfo property from parent

### Changes Made:
- ✅ Updated document_script.lua with refresh sequencing
- ✅ Fixed group_init.lua to keep tag unchanged
- ✅ Updated fader_script.lua to use new method
- ✅ Version bumps applied
- ✅ Debug logging disabled

### Testing Needed:
1. Set up TouchOSC with multiple tracks (e.g., 8 tracks)
2. Verify all faders control correct tracks
3. Insert a new track at position 0 in Ableton
4. Press "Refresh All" button
5. Verify console shows groups being found and refreshed
6. Verify all faders now control the correct renumbered tracks

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Bug Fix (v2)
- Step: Code complete, awaiting test
- Status: CODE_COMPLETE

## Next Steps:
1. User tests the updated fix
2. If successful, merge PR #14
3. If issues remain, enable DEBUG=1 in scripts for detailed logs

## Previous Completed Tasks:
- Notify usage analysis (branch exists but seems abandoned)
- Remove centralized logging (PR #11 merged)
