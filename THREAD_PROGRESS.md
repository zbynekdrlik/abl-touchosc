# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ PHASE 1 OPTIMIZATIONS IMPLEMENTED - READY FOR TESTING**
- [x] Currently working on: Implemented Phase 1 performance optimizations in fader script
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test fader script v2.7.0 with performance improvements
- [ ] Blocked by: Need test results to confirm performance improvements

## Current Status (2025-07-04 15:59 UTC)

### JUST COMPLETED: Phase 1 Performance Optimizations ✅

**Fader Script v2.7.0 Changes:**
1. **Removed logging overhead** ✅
   - Eliminated `root:notify("log_message", ...)` calls
   - Console print only when DEBUG=1
   - DEBUG set to 0 for production

2. **Implemented scheduled updates** ✅  
   - update() now runs at 10Hz (100ms) instead of 60Hz
   - Early exit when nothing to update
   - Adjusted animation speed for new update rate

3. **Added proper debug guards** ✅
   - Early return in debugPrint() when DEBUG != 1
   - No string operations unless debug enabled
   - Zero overhead when DEBUG = 0

### Expected Performance Improvements:
- **Before**: 96 scripts × 60 updates/sec = 5,760 update() calls per second
- **After**: 96 scripts × 10 updates/sec = 960 update() calls per second (83% reduction!)
- **Plus**: No logging notification overhead
- **Plus**: No debug string operations

### Next Steps:
1. Test fader script v2.7.0 on actual hardware
2. Monitor performance improvements
3. Apply same optimizations to other scripts if successful

### Implementation Status
- Phase: 1 - Quick Wins
- Step: Testing Phase 1 optimizations
- Status: TESTING

### Version Tracking
| Script | Version | Changes | Status |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| Fader | v2.7.0 | Performance Phase 1 | Testing |
| Meter | v2.5.7 | Already has throttling | Working |
| Others | Various | Not optimized yet | Working |

## Original Performance Goals (from docs)

### Phase 1 Quick Wins (NOW IMPLEMENTED):
1. ✅ Replace update() with scheduled updates (10Hz)
2. ✅ True debug disabling with early returns  
3. ✅ Remove logging overhead (no notify calls)

### Performance Issue Root Causes:
- "Very laggy response on production tablet"
- "Issues worsen with more tracks (16+)"
- "96+ scripts running constantly"
- "Debug code overhead"

## Test Instructions for User

Please test the updated fader script v2.7.0:

1. Load the updated script on your tablet
2. Check console for version confirmation: "FADER: Script v2.7.0 loaded"
3. Test with 16+ tracks
4. Compare responsiveness to previous version

Look for:
- Smoother fader movement
- Less lag when moving multiple faders
- Overall better performance

Please provide:
- Performance comparison (better/same/worse)
- Any issues or errors
- Console logs if problems occur

## State Saved: 2025-07-04 15:59 UTC
**Status**: Phase 1 optimizations implemented in fader script v2.7.0
**Next Action**: User tests performance improvements on tablet
**Critical**: Need test results before applying to other scripts
