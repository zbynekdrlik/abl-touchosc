# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Pattern matching fixed (v2.4.1) - now detects double-click config correctly
- [x] Bug found: Button is direct state, not toggle
- [x] Fixed in v2.5.0 - proper double-click handling for state button
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test v2.5.0
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: BUG FIX v2 DEPLOYED
- Step: Testing proper button behavior
- Status: AWAITING TEST RESULTS
- Branch: feature/double-click-mute
- PR: #24 (open) - https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/abl-touchosc/pull/24
- Current Version: v2.5.0

## Bug Analysis and Fix

### Original Issue
The button works as a **direct state button**, not a toggle:
- Press (x=0) → Send "mute ON"
- Release (x=1) → Send "mute OFF"
- Visual state directly represents mute state

### Why v2.4.x Failed
- Only blocked the press event
- Release event still sent "mute OFF"
- Result: Always unmuted after first click

### Fix in v2.5.0
- For double-click mode: Changed to toggle behavior
- Tracks waiting state to ignore release events
- Only processes on double-click press
- Toggles between muted/unmuted states

## Configuration (Working)
```yaml
double_click_mute_master: 'master_A-ReproM'  # Pattern matching now works!
```

## What User Needs to Do
1. **Pull latest changes**: `git pull`
2. **Update TouchOSC** with v2.5.0 script
3. **Test the behavior**:
   - Single click: Should do nothing
   - Double-click: Should toggle mute state
   - Release events: Should be ignored

## Expected Behavior with v2.5.0
- First click: Nothing happens (waiting for double-click)
- Second click within 500ms: Toggles mute state
- Release events: Ignored when double-click is enabled

## Testing Progress
- [x] Configuration detected correctly (v2.4.1)
- [ ] Double-click toggles mute
- [ ] Single-click does nothing
- [ ] No unwanted unmuting on release
- [ ] State syncs with Ableton

## Known Issues Fixed
1. ✅ Pattern matching with special characters (v2.4.1)
2. ✅ Momentary button behavior with double-click (v2.5.0)

## Next Thread Should
1. Review v2.5.0 test results
2. If working:
   - Update documentation
   - Update changelog
   - Merge PR
3. If issues remain:
   - Analyze button behavior further
   - Consider alternative approaches
