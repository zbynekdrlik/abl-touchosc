# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ PR #28 IN PROGRESS:**
- [ ] Currently working on: Investigating wrong connection issue for band groups
- [ ] Waiting for: Analysis of OSC message routing
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## ACTIVE WORK: ANDROID TABLET REFRESH ISSUE - NEW DISCOVERY
### Problem Evolution:
1. Initially thought it was timing issue on slower tablets
2. Tried various delays (50ms, 150ms, 500ms, 2s)
3. User discovered the real issue: Groups are processing OSC messages from wrong connection

### Current Investigation:
- Log shows "GROUP(band_STEVO repro#): Track not found: STEVO repro#"
- This group should process band connection messages
- Appears to be processing master connection messages instead
- Need to add logging to see which connection's OSC message is being processed

### Solution Implemented So Far:
1. **500ms delay**: ✅ (but doesn't fix the real issue)
   - `document_script.lua` v2.13.1 - Simple timing approach

### Next Steps:
1. Add logging to show which connection's OSC message groups are processing
2. Verify connection filtering in group_init.lua
3. Fix connection routing issue

## COMPLETED WORK: PR #26 MERGED
### Duplicate Track Names Fix: COMPLETE
- [x] Centralized track names retrieval MERGED
- [x] Prevents duplicate OSC calls during refresh
- [x] Version 2.10.0 released

## COMPLETED WORK: DOUBLE-CLICK MUTE (PR #24)
### Final Status: READY FOR MERGE
- [x] Double-click mute protection COMPLETE AND WORKING
- [x] Documentation cleanup COMPLETE
- [x] Experimental files removed
- [x] README fully documented with two-control approach
- [x] CHANGELOG finalized for v1.5.0
- [x] Ready for merge

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested |

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-10 12:55
- Action: Discovered groups processing wrong connection's OSC messages
- Result: Need to investigate connection filtering
- Next Required: Add logging to identify connection source

## NEXT STEPS
1. Add logging to show which connection OSC messages come from
2. Fix connection filtering in group_init.lua
3. Test on Android tablet again
4. If working, merge PR #28
5. Then merge PR #24 (double-click mute)
6. Create v1.5.0 release
