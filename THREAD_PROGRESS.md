# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ PR #28 IN PROGRESS:**
- [ ] Currently working on: Fix Android tablet refresh timing issue
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing on Android tablet with 200 tracks
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## ACTIVE WORK: ANDROID TABLET REFRESH TIMING FIX
### Problem Identified:
- On slower Android tablets with 200 tracks, faders sometimes not mapped during refresh
- Track name responses arrive before groups process refresh notification
- Timing issue between refresh button and group receive

### Solution Implemented:
1. **Added delay between notify and query**: ✅
   - 50ms delay after notifying groups before querying track names
   - Gives slower devices time to set needsRefresh flag

2. **Updated Scripts**: ✅
   - `document_script.lua` v2.11.0 - Added notifying state with delay

3. **Testing Required**: ❌
   - [ ] Test on Windows TouchOSC (should work normally)
   - [ ] Test on slower Android tablet with 200 tracks
   - [ ] Verify all faders map correctly on both platforms

## COMPLETED WORK: PR #26 MERGED
### Duplicate Track Names Fix: COMPLETE
- [x] Centralized track names retrieval MERGED
- [x] Prevents duplicate OSC calls during refresh
- [x] Version 2.10.0 released

## COMPLETED WORK: DOUBLE-CLICK MUTE (PR #24)
### Final Status: READY FOR MERGE

- [x] Documentation cleanup COMPLETE
- [x] Experimental files removed
- [x] README fully documented with two-control approach
- [x] CHANGELOG finalized for v1.5.0
