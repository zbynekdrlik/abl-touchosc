## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Fix refresh all button for track renumbering
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test the fix
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Current Task: Fix Refresh All Track Renumbering
**Started**: 2025-07-05
**Branch**: fix/refresh-track-renumbering
**Status**: CODE_COMPLETE
**PR**: Ready to create

### Problem:
When inserting a new track at the beginning in Ableton Live, all tracks get renumbered (track 0 becomes track 1, etc.). The refresh all button doesn't properly reassign groups to the correct track numbers, causing faders to control the wrong tracks.

### Solution Implemented:
1. **document_script.lua v2.8.3**:
   - Added refresh sequencing with delay between clear and refresh
   - Send global stop_listen commands to ensure clean state
   - Use state machine for proper sequencing

2. **group_init.lua v1.16.1**:
   - Improved clear_mapping to fully reset all state variables
   - Added logging to track the clearing/refresh process
   - Ensure tag is reset when unmapped

### Changes Made:
- ✅ Updated document_script.lua with refresh sequencing
- ✅ Updated group_init.lua with improved clear_mapping
- ✅ Version bumps applied

### Testing Needed:
1. Set up TouchOSC with multiple tracks (e.g., 8 tracks)
2. Verify all faders control correct tracks
3. Insert a new track at position 0 in Ableton
4. Press "Refresh All" button
5. Verify all faders now control the correct renumbered tracks

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Bug Fix
- Step: Code complete, awaiting test
- Status: CODE_COMPLETE

## Next Steps:
1. User tests the fix with track renumbering scenario
2. If successful, create and merge PR
3. If issues remain, debug based on logs (set DEBUG=1)

## Previous Completed Tasks:
- Notify usage analysis (branch exists but seems abandoned)
- Remove centralized logging (PR #11 merged)
