## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ MUTE BUTTON STATE MANAGEMENT FIXED - OTHER ISSUES REMAIN**
- [x] Currently working on: Fixed mute button state management issue
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test the fix and provide feedback
- [ ] Blocked by: Multiple untested/broken features

## Current Status (2025-07-04 14:20 UTC)

### JUST FIXED:
- **Mute button state management** (v2.0.3)
  - Removed automatic reset to unmuted when track unmapped
  - Button now maintains last known state until Ableton provides update
  - Follows principle: never change state without explicit command

### PREVIOUSLY FIXED:
- **Mute button OSC patterns** - Added to template, now receives updates from Ableton

### STILL NEEDS WORK:
- User satisfaction with mute implementation
- Other controls - Not fully tested
- Performance issues - Unknown if actually improved
- All other features - Need comprehensive testing

### KNOWN ISSUES THAT MAY STILL BE BROKEN:
- Fader behavior - Not confirmed if sync delay fix works
- DB label updates - Not confirmed if volume listener works
- Meter accuracy - Not confirmed if OSC format fix works
- Pan control - Not tested
- Track switching - Not tested if all controls update properly
- Double-tap features - Not tested
- Performance under load - Not tested

## What We Actually Know

### CONFIRMED:
- Mute button NOW receives OSC messages (after template fix)
- Mute button NOW maintains state when track unmapped (v2.0.3)
- Template was missing OSC receive patterns

### NOT CONFIRMED:
- Whether mute button behaves correctly in all scenarios
- Whether any other fixes actually work
- Whether performance is actually improved
- Whether there are additional bugs we haven't found

## Next Steps Required

### Testing Still Needed:
1. Test mute button with new state management fix
2. Test EVERY other control thoroughly
3. Verify fader doesn't jump back
4. Verify DB label shows continuous updates
5. Verify meters show correct levels
6. Test track switching behavior
7. Test double-tap features
8. Test with multiple tracks for performance

### DO NOT ASSUME:
- That any feature works without explicit testing
- That fixing one bug means others are fixed
- That user is satisfied without explicit confirmation
