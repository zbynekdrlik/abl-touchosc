# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Fixed Phase 1 bugs - meter not working, fader jumpy animation
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test fixes and provide feedback on logging preference
- [ ] Blocked by: Need test results before proceeding

## Current Status (2025-07-04 18:48 UTC)

### ⚠️ PHASE 1 BUG FIXES IMPLEMENTED - AWAITING TEST RESULTS

**Issues Fixed:**
1. **Meter Not Working (v2.5.9)** ✅
   - Problem: Meter tried to get connection index before parent initialized
   - Solution: Deferred connection setup until track info available
   - Expected: Meter should now display levels and change colors
   
2. **Fader Jumpy Animation (v2.7.1)** ✅
   - Problem: Double-tap animation jumpy due to 10Hz update rate
   - Solution: Increased update rate to 60Hz
   - Expected: Smooth double-tap animation
   
3. **Verbose Logging** ⚠️
   - Problem: Version logs show even with DEBUG=0
   - Cause: Using `print()` not debug statements
   - Decision needed: Keep, make conditional, or remove?

### VERSION TRACKING - FIXES APPLIED
| Script | Version | Status | Fix Applied |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| fader_script | v2.7.1 | Fixed | 60Hz update rate |
| pan_control | v1.5.0 | Untested | None |
| meter_script | v2.5.9 | Fixed | Connection timing |
| db_label | v1.3.3 | Untested | None |
| mute_button | v2.0.4 | Untested | None |
| db_meter_label | v2.6.2 | Untested | None |
| group_init | v1.16.0 | Untested | None |
| document_script | v2.7.5 | Untested | None |

### TESTING CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Meter displays audio levels correctly
- [ ] Meter status indicator changes color (green/yellow/red)
- [ ] Fader double-tap animation is smooth
- [ ] No regressions in other functionality
- [ ] Decision on version logging approach

### LOGGING OPTIONS:
1. **Keep as-is** - Version logs always show (useful for verification)
2. **Make conditional** - Only show when DEBUG=1
3. **Remove entirely** - Silent operation

### USER'S LAST FEEDBACK (18:33 UTC):
- Meter not working at all, no color changes
- Fader animation jumpy/not fluent
- Logs still verbose even with DEBUG=0

### NEXT STEPS:
1. **User tests the fixes**
2. **User decides on logging preference**
3. **Fix any remaining issues found in testing**
4. **Complete Phase 1 testing checklist**
5. **Only then proceed to Phase 2**

### IMPORTANT NOTES:
- All changes in `feature/performance-optimization` branch
- PR #9 updated with current status
- Do NOT merge until all tests pass
- Phase 1 must be fully tested before Phase 2

## State Saved: 2025-07-04 18:48 UTC
**Status**: Phase 1 bug fixes implemented, awaiting test results
**Branch**: feature/performance-optimization
**Next Action**: User to test meter display, fader animation, and provide logging preference
**Critical**: Need comprehensive testing before claiming Phase 1 complete
