# Thread Progress Tracking

## Current Status
- **Phase**: 3 - Script Functionality Testing
- **Step**: Testing track group scripts and fader functionality
- **Date**: 2025-06-28
- **Branch**: feature/selective-connection-routing

## What We're Actually Testing NOW
- **Track Group Script (group_init.lua v1.7.0)**: Still needs testing verification
- **Individual Control Scripts**: Need testing across multiple Ableton instances
- **Full Fader Functionality**: Not yet verified

## Centralized Logging Architecture ✅ IMPLEMENTED (NOT TESTED)
**Problem Solved**: Scripts are isolated and can't share the logger object directly

**Solution Implemented**: Use notify system for centralized logging
```lua
-- Standard pattern used in all scripts:
local function log(message)
    root:notify("log_message", "CONTEXT: " .. message)
    print("[timestamp] " .. message)  -- Console backup
end
```

**Document script (v2.5.9)** handles all log messages:
- Receives "log_message" notifications
- Maintains log buffer
- Updates logger text object
- Provides consistent formatting

## Phase 3 Progress - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE, TESTING IN PROGRESS

### Script Versions (All with Centralized Logging)
- **document_script.lua**: v2.5.9 ✅ (log handler)
- **group_init.lua**: v1.7.0 ✅ (fixed pcall, added logging) - NEEDS TESTING
- **global_refresh_button.lua**: v1.4.0 ✅ (cleaned up, added logging)
- **fader_script.lua**: v2.1.0 ✅ (added logging) - NEEDS TESTING
- **meter_script.lua**: v2.1.0 ✅ (added logging) - NEEDS TESTING
- **mute_button.lua**: v1.1.0 ✅ (added logging) - NEEDS TESTING
- **pan_control.lua**: v1.1.0 ✅ (added logging) - NEEDS TESTING

### Testing Required
1. **Track Group Script Testing**
   - [ ] Initialize track groups properly
   - [ ] Logging shows correct initialization
   - [ ] Controls are found and configured
   - [ ] Connection routing works correctly

2. **Individual Control Testing** 
   - [ ] Fader controls volume correctly
   - [ ] Meter displays levels
   - [ ] Mute button toggles state
   - [ ] Pan control adjusts position
   - [ ] All controls log their actions

3. **Multi-Ableton Testing**
   - [ ] Test with multiple Ableton instances
   - [ ] Verify correct connection routing
   - [ ] Ensure no cross-talk between instances
   - [ ] Confirm each instance updates independently

### Deep Cleanup Completed
1. ✅ Removed all debug/test code from scripts
2. ✅ Standardized logging pattern across all scripts
3. ✅ Fixed pcall error (not available in TouchOSC)
4. ✅ Updated documentation with logging pattern
5. ✅ All scripts now log to both console AND logger text

### Logging Pattern Summary
Each script uses a consistent pattern:
- **Group**: "CONTROL(groupname): message"
- **Refresh Button**: "REFRESH BUTTON: message"
- **Fader**: "FADER(parent): message"
- **Meter**: "METER(parent): message"
- **Mute**: "MUTE(parent): message"
- **Pan**: "PAN(parent): message"

### Documentation Updated
- **touchosc-lua-rules.md**: Added centralized logging pattern (Rule #11)
- Added pcall limitation documentation (Rule #16)
- Updated testing checklist

## Key Architecture Decisions
1. **Centralized Logging**: All scripts use notify() to send logs to document script
2. **Context Prefixes**: Each log includes context for debugging
3. **Console Backup**: All logs also print to console for development
4. **Version Logging**: Every script logs its version on init
5. **Document Script Required**: Must be v2.5.9+ for log_message handler

## Next Steps
1. Test track group initialization with logging
2. Verify all control scripts function correctly
3. Test with multiple Ableton instances
4. Collect logs showing successful operations
5. Fix any issues found during testing

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Document script v2.5.9 handles log_message
- [x] All control scripts use centralized logging
- [ ] Track groups initialize properly
- [ ] Faders control volume
- [ ] Meters show levels
- [ ] Mute buttons work
- [ ] Pan controls function
- [ ] Multi-Ableton routing verified
- [ ] No cross-talk between instances
- [ ] All operations logged properly

## Summary
The centralized logging system is implemented but NOT fully tested. We need to:
1. Test track group script functionality
2. Verify all control scripts work correctly
3. Test with multiple Ableton instances
4. Collect comprehensive logs showing everything works
