# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ PR #28 - ISSUE SOLVED BUT CLEANUP NEEDED:**
- [x] Currently working on: Issue SOLVED - was timing bug in group_init.lua
- [ ] Waiting for: New thread to revert unnecessary changes
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## SOLUTION FOUND: ANDROID TABLET REFRESH ISSUE
### Root Cause Identified:
The issue was in `group_init.lua` - track names were being cleared between processing regular tracks and return tracks. On slower Android tablets, this timing issue caused tracks to appear as "not found" even though they were received.

### Fix Applied (v1.17.4):
- Added `processedRegularTracks` and `processedReturnTracks` flags
- Preserved track names between OSC messages
- Only report "Track not found" after BOTH types processed
- This ensures regular track names are still in memory when return tracks arrive

### Why It Happened on Android:
- Slower tablets have longer delays between OSC messages
- Regular tracks from conn2 were received, then cleared before return tracks arrived
- Windows TouchOSC processes faster, masking the issue

### What WASN'T the Problem:
- The 500ms delay in document_script.lua (v2.13.1) - NOT NEEDED
- All the timing experiments - NOT NEEDED
- These changes should be reverted

## NEXT STEPS FOR NEW THREAD
1. **Revert unnecessary changes:**
   - Remove 500ms delay from document_script.lua
   - Keep only the group_init.lua fix (v1.17.4+)
   - Clean up PR #28 description

2. **Update all groups:**
   - All group controls need the fixed group_init.lua script
   - Version 1.17.4 or higher has the fix

3. **Test and merge:**
   - Verify fix works without the delays
   - Merge cleaned-up PR #28
   - Then merge PR #24 (double-click mute)
   - Create v1.5.0 release

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-10 14:55
- Action: Confirmed v1.17.7 fixes the issue - track now maps correctly
- Result: Issue SOLVED - was timing bug in group_init.lua
- Next Required: New thread to revert unnecessary timing delays

## Key Learning
The issue wasn't about slow refresh or timing delays. It was a race condition where track names were being cleared between receiving regular and return track lists. The fix was to preserve the data until both lists were processed.
