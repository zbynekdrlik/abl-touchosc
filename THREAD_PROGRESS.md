# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: IDENTIFIED ROOT CAUSE - Architectural mistake with notify()
- [ ] Waiting for: Deep analysis of OSC handling in all scripts
- [ ] Blocked by: Need to revert to direct OSC handling everywhere

## Current Status (2025-07-04 19:40 UTC)

### üö® CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

**THE PROBLEM**: Optimization branch incorrectly changed from direct OSC handling to notify() system!

**Main Branch (CORRECT):**
- Each control receives OSC messages directly
- Each control updates itself immediately
- No notification chains
- RESULT: Fast and fluent

**Optimization Branch (INCORRECT):**
- Only some controls receive OSC
- They notify parent ‚Üí parent notifies siblings
- Creates notification chains and delays
- RESULT: Laggy and unresponsive

### EXAMPLES OF THE PROBLEM:

1. **Meter in main**: Receives `/live/track/get/output_meter_level` ‚Üí Updates directly
2. **Meter in optimization**: Receives OSC ‚Üí Notifies parent ‚Üí Parent notifies db_meter_label ‚Üí LAG!

3. **db_meter_label in main**: Should receive OSC directly
4. **db_meter_label in optimization**: Waits for notify from parent ‚Üí LAG!

### GOAL FOR NEXT THREAD:

**COMPLETE ARCHITECTURAL FIX**:
1. Analyze EVERY script to find where OSC was replaced with notify()
2. Restore direct OSC handling in ALL controls
3. Remove unnecessary notify() chains
4. Each control should be self-sufficient

### SCRIPTS THAT NEED ANALYSIS:
- [ ] meter_script.lua - Remove parent notify, ensure direct updates
- [ ] db_meter_label.lua - Add direct OSC receive instead of notify
- [ ] db_label.lua - Check if using notify instead of OSC
- [ ] fader_script.lua - Verify it's not notifying unnecessarily
- [ ] pan_control.lua - Check OSC vs notify usage
- [ ] mute_button.lua - Verify direct OSC handling
- [ ] group_init.lua - Remove value_changed forwarding

### KEY PRINCIPLE:
**Every control that needs data should receive it directly via OSC, NOT through notify chains!**

### USER'S REPEATED WARNINGS (that were missed):
- "notify needs be analyzed"
- "Originally in main it was done over osc receive in each object"
- "this is totally incorrect approach"

## State Saved: 2025-07-04 19:40 UTC
**Status**: Root cause identified - architectural mistake with notify()
**Branch**: feature/performance-optimization  
**Next Action**: Deep analysis and fix ALL scripts to use direct OSC
**Critical**: This explains why meter is laggy - it's going through notification chains instead of direct updates!
