# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION - PHASE 1 IN PROGRESS**
- [x] Currently working on: Performance optimization Phase 1 - Quick Wins
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing of optimized scripts
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Current Status (2025-07-04)

### Performance Optimization - Phase 1
- **Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS
- **Version**: 1.3.0 (target)
- **Branch**: feature/performance-optimization
- **Focus**: Quick wins for immediate impact

### Tasks - Phase 1
- [x] Replace continuous update() with scheduled updates in group_init.lua
- [x] Fix debug code overhead in fader_script.lua
- [ ] Reduce status update frequency in meter_script.lua
- [ ] Test on production hardware
- [ ] Measure performance improvements

## Implementation Status - PERFORMANCE
- Phase: 1 of 4 - Quick Wins
- Step: Initial optimizations implemented
- Status: IMPLEMENTING

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Optimization | Implemented | Tested | Performance Gain |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| group_init | Scheduled updates @ 100ms | ‚úÖ v1.15.0 | ‚ùå | Target: 30% |
| fader_script | Debug fixes + optimized update() | ‚úÖ v2.5.0 | ‚ùå | Target: 20% |
| meter_script | Reduce frequency | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Target: 15% |
| All scripts | Debug guards | ‚è≥ Partial | ‚ùå | Target: 10% |

## Changes Made

### 1. group_init.lua (v1.14.5 ‚Üí v1.15.0)
- Replaced continuous `update()` with `onSchedule()`
- Activity monitoring now runs every 100ms instead of every frame
- Expected reduction: ~30% CPU usage for group management

### 2. fader_script.lua (v2.4.1 ‚Üí v2.5.0)
- Fixed debug function with early return when DEBUG=0
- Optimized `update()` to skip when no sync/animation needed
- Added scheduled sync checking at 50ms intervals
- Expected reduction: ~20% CPU usage for fader controls

## Previous Work Complete
- ‚úÖ Return track feature (v1.2.0) - MERGED
- ‚úÖ Performance documentation created
- ‚úÖ Performance optimization plan ready

## Performance Issues Identified
1. **Excessive Update Frequency**: Scripts run 60-120Hz ‚úÖ PARTIALLY FIXED
2. **Debug Overhead**: String operations even when DEBUG=0 ‚úÖ PARTIALLY FIXED
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Constant calculations ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
4. **Complex Calculations**: Smoothing on every frame ‚ùå NOT STARTED

## Next Steps

### 1. Continue Quick Wins üéØ
Priority order:
1. ~~group_init.lua - Remove continuous update()~~ ‚úÖ DONE
2. ~~fader_script.lua - Fix debug overhead~~ ‚úÖ DONE
3. meter_script.lua - Reduce update frequency ‚è≥ NEXT
4. All scripts - Proper DEBUG guards ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS

### 2. Testing Protocol
- [ ] User needs to test with optimized scripts
- [ ] Baseline performance with current version
- [ ] Test with 8, 16, 24, 32 tracks
- [ ] Measure CPU usage and response time
- [ ] Document improvements

### 3. User Action Required
Please test the optimized scripts:
1. Update TouchOSC with new script versions
2. Test with multiple tracks (8+)
3. Check if lag/performance improved
4. Provide logs showing version numbers loaded
5. Report any issues or regressions

## Key Decisions

1. **Phased approach** - Start with easy wins
2. **Maintain functionality** - No feature regression
3. **Measure everything** - Data-driven optimization

## Branch Status

- Implementation: üöß In Progress (2/4 scripts optimized)
- Documentation: ‚úÖ Ready
- Testing: ‚ùå Awaiting user test
- **Ready for merge: NO**

## Performance Targets

- Response time: < 100ms (from ~300ms)
- CPU usage: < 30% (from ~80%)
- Smooth operation: 16+ tracks
- Frame rate: 30+ FPS consistent

## Last Actions
- Optimized group_init.lua with scheduled updates
- Optimized fader_script.lua with debug fixes
- Ready for user testing of Phase 1 optimizations
