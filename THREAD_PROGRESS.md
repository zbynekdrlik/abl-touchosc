# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fixed redundant track name requests during refresh
- [ ] Currently working on: Testing the fix
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test refresh with OSC logs
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Recent Fix Applied (v2.9.1 + v1.16.5)
### Issue Fixed:
- Multiple faders were each requesting track names during refresh
- This caused redundant `/live/song/get/track_names` calls
- If 10 faders existed, 10 identical requests were sent

### Solution Implemented:
1. **Document Script v2.9.1**: Now sends track name requests once per connection during refresh
2. **Group Init v1.16.5**: Removed redundant requests, now just waits for the response

### Testing Required:
- Enable OSC logging in TouchOSC
- Press refresh button
- Verify only one track names request per connection
- Confirm all faders still map correctly

## FINAL STATUS: READY FOR PRODUCTION
### Completed Tasks:
1. **File Cleanup**: ✅
   - [x] Removed `mute_label.lua` (experimental, not used)
   - [x] All scripts have correct version numbers
   - [x] No debug flags enabled (DEBUG = 0)

2. **Documentation Updates**: ✅
   - [x] README updated with complete double-click mute section
   - [x] Template setup instructions included
   - [x] Configuration examples added
   - [x] Both button and label setup documented

3. **Changelog Finalization**: ✅
   - [x] Moved double-click mute to v1.5.0
   - [x] All changes documented
   - [x] Version number and date added

4. **PR Readiness**: ✅
   - [x] PR description reflects final implementation
   - [x] All commits meaningful
   - [x] No conflicts with main branch
   - [x] Ready for merge after refresh fix is tested

## PRODUCTION-READY COMPONENTS
### Final Solution Architecture:
```
[Button Control] + [Display Label]

- ✅ Single-click for normal tracks
- ✅ Solid color feedback on buttons
- ✅ Configuration via simple text format
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ Efficient refresh (no redundant OSC calls)

## CONFIGURATION FORMAT (FINAL)
