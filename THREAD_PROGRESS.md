# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è MUTE BUTTON OSC TYPE ISSUE FOUND:**
- [x] Problem identified: TouchOSC sends FLOAT, Ableton expects BOOL
- [x] Currently working on: Reverting to old behavior pattern
- [ ] Testing v2.1.3 with integer values and x value handling
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test updated version
- [ ] Branch: feature/restore-mute-color-behavior

## Current Task: Fix Mute Button OSC Type Mismatch
**Started**: 2025-07-05  
**Branch**: feature/restore-mute-color-behavior
**Status**: TESTING_FAILED - Fixing OSC type issue
**PR**: #19 - In progress

### Issue Discovered:
- Ableton error: `Python argument types in None.None(Track, float) did not match C++ signature: None(class TTrackPyHandle, bool)`
- TouchOSC is sending FLOAT values even when we send booleans
- Need to match old behavior exactly

### Fix Attempts:
1. ‚úÖ **v2.1.0**: Removed color control (main goal achieved)
2. ‚ùå **v2.1.1**: Debug version - revealed no OSC being sent to Ableton
3. ‚ùå **v2.1.2**: Send boolean values - TouchOSC converts to FLOAT anyway
4. üîÑ **v2.1.3**: Revert to old behavior:
   - Use onValueChanged("x") instead of touch events
   - Send integer values (0/1) 
   - Match old inverted logic exactly

### Testing Log Analysis:
```
OSC Send: /live/return/set/mute FLOAT(0) FLOAT(0)
Ableton Error: Expected (Track, bool) but got (Track, float)
```

## Previous Tasks Completed:

### Pan Control Restoration (COMPLETE) ‚úÖ
**Branch**: feature/restore-pan-features (PR #18 - Ready to merge)
- All features tested and working

## Pending PRs:
1. **PR #19** - Mute Button Color Fix (FIXING OSC ISSUE)
   - Color control removed ‚úÖ
   - OSC type mismatch being fixed üîÑ
   
2. **PR #18** - Pan Control Restoration (ready to merge) ‚úÖ
3. **PR #16** - Group Interactivity Fix (ready to merge)
4. **PR #15** - Refresh Track Renumbering Fix (ready to merge)

## Key Findings:
1. **Old v1.9.1 behavior**:
   - Used onValueChanged("x")
   - Sent inverted x value: x=0 ‚Üí 1, x=1 ‚Üí 0
   - No color manipulation
   - Worked with Ableton

2. **Current v2.0.1 issues**:
   - Used touch events (different behavior)
   - Added color manipulation
   - OSC type mismatch with Ableton

3. **TouchOSC limitation**: 
   - Converts all values to FLOAT in OSC messages
   - Ableton strictly requires boolean type
   - Need to find what made old version work

## Next Steps:
1. Test v2.1.3 to see if reverting to old pattern works
2. May need to investigate OSC message formatting
3. Check if old version had special OSC type handling

## Session Summary:
Found the root cause - TouchOSC sends FLOAT values but Ableton expects boolean. The old version must have had a workaround. Currently testing reverted behavior pattern.
