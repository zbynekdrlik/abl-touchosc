# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ MUTE BUTTON FIX - OSC TYPE MISMATCH BLOCKING:**
- [x] Problem identified: TouchOSC sends FLOAT, Ableton expects BOOL
- [x] Currently at: v2.1.3 awaiting test results
- [ ] Testing required: Does v2.1.3 work with Ableton?
- [ ] Blocked by: OSC type conversion issue
- [ ] Branch: feature/restore-mute-color-behavior

## EXACT PROBLEM STATEMENT:
User reported mute button colors being overridden by script. While fixing this (successfully removed color control), discovered mute functionality is broken due to OSC type mismatch:

**Error from Ableton:**
```
Error handling OSC message: Python argument types in
    None.None(Track, float)
did not match C++ signature:
    None(class TTrackPyHandle, bool)
```

**OSC Log shows TouchOSC sending:**
```
SEND | ADDRESS(/live/return/set/mute) FLOAT(0) FLOAT(0)
```

## Version History in This Thread:
1. **v2.0.1** (starting point): Had color override + touch events
2. **v2.1.0**: Removed color control (main goal ✅)
3. **v2.1.1**: Added debug logging (DEBUG=1)
4. **v2.1.2**: Tried sending boolean values - didn't work
5. **v2.1.3**: Reverted to old pattern - AWAITING TEST

## Key Code Changes in v2.1.3:
```lua
-- Using onValueChanged("x") like old version
-- Sending integer values with inverted logic:
local muteValue = (self.values.x == 0) and 1 or 0
sendOSC(path, trackNumber, muteValue, connections)
```

## What Old Version (1.9.1) Did:
- Used `onValueChanged("x")` 
- Sent inverted x as boolean: `(self.values.x == 0)`
- No color manipulation
- Somehow worked with Ableton despite TouchOSC FLOAT issue

## Critical Question for Next Thread:
How did the old version handle the bool/float type mismatch? Options:
1. Old TouchOSC version sent proper booleans?
2. Old Ableton Live version accepted floats?
3. Some other script/setting converted types?
4. Need different OSC message format?

## Pending PRs Status:
1. **PR #19** - Mute Button Fix (THIS BRANCH)
   - Color control removed ✅
   - OSC functionality broken ❌
   - Need to solve type mismatch
   
2. **PR #18** - Pan Control Restoration
   - COMPLETE & TESTED ✅
   - Ready to merge
   
3. **PR #16** - Group Interactivity Fix
   - Ready to merge
   
4. **PR #15** - Refresh Track Renumbering Fix  
   - Ready to merge

## Files Modified in This Branch:
- `/scripts/track/mute_button.lua` (v2.1.3)
- `/CHANGELOG.md` (updated with mute fix entry)
- `/THREAD_PROGRESS.md` (this file)

## Next Steps for New Thread:
1. **TEST v2.1.3** - Get logs to see if reverting to old pattern works
2. If still broken, investigate:
   - Compare with working scripts (fader/pan) OSC sending
   - Check if TouchOSC has boolean type support
   - Test with different OSC message formats
3. Consider asking user:
   - TouchOSC version?
   - Ableton Live version?
   - When did it last work?

## User's Original Complaint:
"I am mainly unhappy that new code mess with colors what was working perfectly in previous version and visually correct, now colors are broken and not able to fix in touchosc editor. I want have old way of manage colors by user not by script"

**Color issue: FIXED in all versions ✅**
**Functionality issue: DISCOVERED during testing ❌**

## Session End State:
- Awaiting test results for v2.1.3
- Main goal (color control) achieved
- Secondary issue (OSC type) blocking functionality
- All changes committed to feature branch
- PR #19 created but not ready to merge
