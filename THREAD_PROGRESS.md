# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: dB meter label display based on audio output
- [x] Created new feature branch: feature/db-meter
- [x] Created db_meter_label.lua script v2.0.0 with correct calibration
- [x] Added calibration rule documentation
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test the calibrated dB meter script
- [ ] Ready for: Merge after successful testing

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Feature Development - dB Meter Display
- Step: Script complete with proper calibration
- Status: READY FOR TESTING

## Feature: Add dBFS Meter Display Based on Track Output
Creating a proper peak dBFS meter that shows actual audio level from track output meter.

### Final Solution (v2.0.0)
- Complete rewrite with proper meter calibration
- Based on verified reference: OSC meter 0.631 = -22 dBFS in Ableton
- Uses standard logarithmic conversion: 20 * log10(meter_value)
- Applies calibration offset to match Ableton's display exactly
- Handles floating-point headroom for values > 0 dBFS

### Key Calibration Points
- OSC value `0.631` = `-22 dBFS` (verified by user)
- OSC value `0.842` = `-6 dBFS` (from logs)
- OSC value `0.0` = `-∞ dBFS`
- OSC value `1.0` = `0 dBFS`
- OSC value `>1.0` = positive dBFS (floating-point headroom)

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| db_meter_label.lua | ✅ v2.0.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Calibration rule | ✅ | - | - | - |

## Script Versions - Feature Branch
| Script | Version | Status |
|--------|---------|---------|
| db_meter_label.lua | 2.0.0 | ✅ Properly calibrated to match Ableton |

### Version History
- v1.0.0: Initial implementation (incorrect calibration)
- v1.0.1: Updated to use proper "dBFS" unit notation
- v1.1.0: Extended to handle floating-point headroom (still wrong calibration)
- v1.1.1: Fixed timeout issue causing premature -∞ display
- **v2.0.0: Complete rewrite with verified calibration**

## TouchOSC Integration Steps
User needs to:
1. Open TouchOSC editor
2. Add a new Label control to each track group
3. Name it exactly: `db_meter_label`
4. Position it near the existing meter
5. Attach the `db_meter_label.lua` script to it
6. Set OSC receive pattern: `/live/track/get/output_meter_level`
7. Size label to fit text like "-12.5 dBFS" (10-11 characters)
8. Test with actual audio playback

## Technical Implementation
```lua
-- Calibrated conversion based on verified reference point
local METER_REFERENCE = 0.631  -- This equals -22 dBFS in Ableton
local DB_REFERENCE = -22.0

-- Standard logarithmic conversion with calibration
local db_raw = 20 * math.log10(meter_normalized)
local db_raw_at_reference = 20 * math.log10(METER_REFERENCE)
local calibration_offset = DB_REFERENCE - db_raw_at_reference
local db_calibrated = db_raw + calibration_offset
```

## Documentation Created
- `rules/abletonosc-meter-calibration.md` - Calibration formula and explanation
- Documented why previous attempts failed
- Preserved verified calibration points for future reference

## Next Steps
1. User tests the calibrated meter
2. Verify values match Ableton's display exactly
3. If successful, merge PR
4. Close old LUFS feature branch
