# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è ALL SCRIPTS OPTIMIZED - READY FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING**
- [x] Fixed: All scripts now have performance optimizations
- [x] Completed: Found and optimized 4 additional scripts that were missed
- [ ] Currently working on: Awaiting user test of ALL optimizations
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing of complete optimization package
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Current Status (2025-07-04)

### ALL Scripts Now Optimized ‚úÖ
Just completed optimization of 4 scripts that were missed:
- **db_label.lua** ‚Üí v1.3.0 (removed logger, added DEBUG guards)
- **db_meter_label.lua** ‚Üí v2.6.0 (removed logger, removed empty update(), improved DEBUG)
- **mute_button.lua** ‚Üí v2.0.0 (removed logger, added DEBUG guards)
- **global_refresh_button.lua** ‚Üí v1.5.0 (removed logger, scheduled updates, DEBUG guards)

### Critical Fix Applied (Previously)
- **Issue**: Faders jumping to 0, pan jumping to full right when no connection
- **Root Cause**: Controls processing value changes even when track not mapped
- **Solution**: Added `has_valid_position` flag to prevent ANY movement until Ableton sends data
- **Scripts Updated**:
  - fader_script.lua ‚Üí v2.5.3
  - pan_control.lua ‚Üí v1.4.2

### Performance Optimization - Phase 1
- **Status**: ‚úÖ ALL SCRIPTS COMPLETED
- **Version**: 1.3.0 (target)
- **Branch**: feature/performance-optimization
- **Focus**: Quick wins for immediate impact

### Tasks - Phase 1 (ALL COMPLETED)
- [x] Replace continuous update() with scheduled updates in group_init.lua
- [x] Fix debug code overhead in fader_script.lua
- [x] Reduce status update frequency in meter_script.lua
- [x] Remove all logger code per user request
- [x] Fix critical bug: prevent control movement without connection
- [x] Optimize ALL remaining scripts (db_label, db_meter_label, mute_button, global_refresh_button)
- [ ] Test on production hardware
- [ ] Measure performance improvements

## Implementation Status - PERFORMANCE
- Phase: 1 of 4 - Quick Wins + Critical Fix + Complete Script Coverage
- Step: ALL optimizations implemented across ALL scripts
- Status: AWAITING COMPREHENSIVE TEST

## Changes Made - Complete List

### TODAY'S ADDITIONS (2025-07-04)

#### 1. db_label.lua (v1.2.0 ‚Üí v1.3.0)
- **REMOVED**: Centralized logging system
- **ADDED**: DEBUG guard with early return
- **ADDED**: Direct debug prints only when DEBUG=1
- Expected reduction: ~5% CPU usage

#### 2. db_meter_label.lua (v2.5.1 ‚Üí v2.6.0)
- **REMOVED**: Centralized logging system
- **REMOVED**: Empty update() function
- **IMPROVED**: DEBUG implementation throughout
- **ADDED**: Direct debug prints only when DEBUG=1
- Expected reduction: ~8% CPU usage

#### 3. mute_button.lua (v1.9.1 ‚Üí v2.0.0)
- **REMOVED**: Centralized logging system
- **ADDED**: DEBUG guard with early return
- **ADDED**: Direct debug prints only when DEBUG=1
- Expected reduction: ~3% CPU usage

#### 4. global_refresh_button.lua (v1.4.0 ‚Üí v1.5.0)
- **REMOVED**: Centralized logging system
- **REMOVED**: Continuous update() for color reset
- **ADDED**: Scheduled callback for color reset (300ms)
- **ADDED**: DEBUG guard with early return
- Expected reduction: ~5% CPU usage

### CRITICAL FIX (Earlier Today)

#### fader_script.lua & pan_control.lua
- **ADDED**: `has_valid_position` flag
- **FIXED**: Controls no longer jump when disconnected
- **RESULT**: Position stability maintained

### Previous Phase 1 Optimizations

#### group_init.lua, fader_script.lua, meter_script.lua, document_script.lua
- Scheduled updates instead of continuous
- Logger removal
- DEBUG guards
- Expected reduction: ~60% combined

## Performance Improvements Summary

### Overall Optimization Coverage: 100%
- ‚úÖ ALL 9 scripts now optimized
- ‚úÖ Logger completely removed from entire project
- ‚úÖ All scripts use DEBUG guards (no overhead when DEBUG=0)
- ‚úÖ No continuous update() loops remain (all scheduled or removed)
- ‚úÖ Position stability fix prevents unwanted control movement

### Expected Performance Gains
- **CPU Usage**: 60-80% reduction expected
- **Response Time**: < 100ms (from ~300ms)
- **Frame Rate**: Consistent 30+ FPS
- **Track Capacity**: Smooth operation with 32+ tracks

## Next Steps

### 1. Comprehensive User Testing Required üéØ
Please test ALL optimized scripts:
1. Update TouchOSC with ALL new script versions
2. **Test behavior WITHOUT Ableton connection**:
   - Faders should stay at current position (not jump to 0)
   - Pan should stay at current position (not jump to full right)
   - All other controls should function normally
3. **Test behavior WITH Ableton connection**:
   - Controls should sync to Ableton positions
   - Normal operation should resume
   - All features should work as before
4. Set DEBUG=0 in all scripts (default)
5. Test with multiple tracks (8, 16, 24, 32)
6. Check if lag/performance improved across the board
7. Test mute buttons, dB labels, meter labels
8. Test global refresh button
9. Provide CPU usage comparison if possible
10. Report any issues or regressions

### 2. Expected Results
- **NO MORE JUMPING**: Controls stay where they are when disconnected
- **Significantly smoother** operation overall
- **Much less lag** with many tracks
- **Lower CPU usage** across all components
- **No visible logging** (DEBUG=0)
- **All features still work** as expected

### 3. Phase 2 Preview (After Testing)
If Phase 1 complete optimization successful, Phase 2 will include:
- State caching to reduce OSC traffic
- Batch processing for multiple updates
- Further architectural improvements

## Key Decisions

1. **Logger removed** - Using TouchOSC's built-in logview
2. **Debug off by default** - Zero performance impact
3. **Complete coverage** - ALL scripts optimized
4. **Maintain functionality** - No feature regression
5. **Position preservation** - Controls never move without real data

## Branch Status

- Implementation: ‚úÖ Complete (ALL scripts optimized)
- Documentation: ‚úÖ Updated
- Testing: ‚ùå Awaiting comprehensive user test
- **Ready for merge: NO** (needs testing)

## Performance Targets

- Response time: < 100ms (from ~300ms)
- CPU usage: < 30% (from ~80%)
- Smooth operation: 32+ tracks
- Frame rate: 30+ FPS consistent
- **Control stability**: No unwanted movement
- **Complete optimization**: All scripts performing optimally
