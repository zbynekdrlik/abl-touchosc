## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ WORKING ON PAN CONTROL RESTORATION:**

- [ ] Waiting for: User to test color change and double-tap functionality
- [ ] Branch: feature/restore-pan-features
- [ ] PR #18 created

## Current Task: Restore Missing Pan Control Features
**Started**: 2025-07-05  
**Branch**: feature/restore-pan-features
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
**PR**: #18 - Implementation complete, awaiting testing

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ **pan_control.lua v1.5.1 → v1.5.2**:
   - Restored color change functionality
   - Added COLOR_CENTERED and COLOR_OFF_CENTER constants
   - Restored update() function for visual feedback
   - Restored double-tap detection logic
   - Added DOUBLE_TAP_DELAY constant (300ms)
   - Integrated double-tap handling in onValueChanged()
   - Set initial color in init()

### Features Restored:
1. **Color Change**: 
   - Gray (#646464) when pan is centered
   - Cyan (#34C1DC) when pan is off-center
   - Uses update() function to continuously check position

2. **Double-tap to Center**:
   - 300ms time window for double-tap detection
   - Centers pan to 0.5 (TouchOSC) / 0 (Ableton)
   - Sends OSC message to update Ableton

### Missing Features Analysis:
Based on comparison with old v1.4.1 code, these were the only missing features. The current version has additional improvements like:
- Better state management
- Connection routing support
- Notify handlers for track changes
- Touch state tracking to prevent jumps

## Testing Needed:
- [ ] Verify color changes when moving pan
- [ ] Test double-tap centers the pan
- [ ] Confirm no performance issues
- [ ] Test with regular tracks
- [ ] Test with return tracks
- [ ] Verify multi-connection support
