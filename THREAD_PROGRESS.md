## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] AbletonOSC forked and return track support implemented
- [x] Pull request created: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC/pull/2
- [x] **TESTED AND WORKING**: Return tracks are now accessible!
- [ ] **Currently working on**: Creating TouchOSC templates for return tracks
- [ ] **Next step**: Implement return track controls in TouchOSC

## Implementation Status
- Phase: 2 - TouchOSC Template Implementation
- Step: Creating return track controls
- Status: AbletonOSC fork TESTED AND WORKING

## Test Results - SUCCESS! ✅
```
12:48:19.584 | RECEIVE | ADDRESS(/live/song/get/num_return_tracks) INT32(1)
12:48:19.584 | RECEIVE | ADDRESS(/live/song/get/return_track_names) STRING(A-Repro Sala LR)
12:48:19.584 | RECEIVE | ADDRESS(/live/return/get/volume) INT32(0) FLOAT(0.85)
```

- Return tracks are accessible
- Commands work without errors
- Volume control confirmed working

## AbletonOSC Fork Details
- Fork repository: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC
- Branch: feature/return-tracks-support
- PR: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC/pull/2
- **STATUS: WORKING IN PRODUCTION**

### Implemented OSC Commands:
1. **Song-level queries**:
   - `/live/song/get/num_return_tracks` ✅
   - `/live/song/get/return_track_names` ✅
   - `/live/song/get/return_track_data` ✅

2. **Return track controls** (`/live/return/`):
   - Volume, panning, mute, solo ✅
   - Send controls ✅
   - Device queries ✅
   - Clip operations ✅
   - Output routing ✅

## Next Steps - TouchOSC Templates
1. Create return track mixer strip
2. Add send controls for return tracks
3. Implement return track metering
4. Create dynamic return track detection

## Original Investigation
- Problem: AbletonOSC didn't expose return tracks
- Solution: Forked and added support
- Result: WORKING - Return tracks fully accessible
