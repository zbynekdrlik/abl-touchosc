# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: State reset issue STILL NOT FIXED - mute buttons still resetting
- [ ] Waiting for: Debug logs from user to understand why state queries aren't working
- [ ] Blocked by: Need diagnostic information

## CRITICAL BUG STILL ACTIVE
**Mute buttons are still resetting after refresh despite adding state queries!**

User reports that mute buttons are still switching state after "refresh all". This means our fix in v1.17.2 where we added:
```lua
-- CRITICAL FIX: Query current state after starting listeners
sendOSC('/live/track/get/volume', trackNumber, targetConnections)
sendOSC('/live/track/get/mute', trackNumber, targetConnections)
sendOSC('/live/track/get/panning', trackNumber, targetConnections)
```

...is NOT working as expected.

## Debugging Focus for Next Thread
1. **Verify state queries are being sent**
   - Add logging to confirm queries are sent
   - Check if queries are sent to correct connection

2. **Check if state responses are received**
   - Log all incoming OSC messages after mapping
   - Verify mute_button.lua is handling the responses

3. **Timing issues**
   - State queries might be sent too early
   - Responses might arrive before children are ready

4. **Child script issues**
   - Check mute_button.lua onReceiveOSC handler
   - Verify it processes /live/track/get/mute responses

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Android tablet fix - DEBUGGING NEEDED
- Step: State queries added but NOT WORKING
- Status: BUG STILL ACTIVE

## The Fixes Applied (But Not Working Fully)
1. **Race Condition Fix (v1.17.1)**: ✅ WORKING
   - Added `processedRegularTracks` and `processedReturnTracks` flags
   - Prevents "Track not found" errors - THIS PART WORKS

2. **State Reset Fix (v1.17.2)** - ❌ NOT WORKING
   - Added state queries after successful mapping
   - Queries volume, mute, and panning after starting listeners
   - BUT mute buttons still reset!

## Next Thread Requirements
1. User will provide logs showing:
   - Mute button state before refresh
   - What happens during refresh
   - Final state after refresh
   
2. Need to add debug logging to:
   - group_init.lua - log when state queries are sent
   - mute_button.lua - log all OSC messages received
   - Track the exact sequence of events

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| group_init v1.17.2 | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ BUG FOUND | ❌ |

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-22
- Action: Tested PR #29 - race condition fixed but mute still resets
- Result: Need to debug why state queries aren't preventing reset
- Next Required: Will provide logs for debugging

## Branch Summary
- `main` - stable baseline (v1.17.0)
- `fix/android-track-clearing` - THIS BRANCH - race condition fixed, state query NOT working (v1.17.2)
- `fix/android-tablet-refresh-timing` - backup branch with all debugging/experiments

## DO NOT MERGE PR #29 YET - STILL HAS BUGS!
