# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è FADER FIXED - TESTING NEEDED**
- [x] Currently working on: Fixed fader script v2.6.1
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test if fader now works
- [ ] Blocked by: Need to verify fader fix before addressing other issues

## Current Status (2025-07-04 14:46 UTC)

### JUST FIXED:
- **Fader Script v2.6.1** - Major fixes applied:
  - Fixed `onValueChanged()` signature (TouchOSC doesn't support parameters)
  - Removed send control complexity that was breaking volume
  - Restored all movement scaling from main branch
  - Kept performance optimizations (event-driven, no continuous polling)

### STILL BROKEN (awaiting test results):
- **Status indicator** - Not working at all (need to identify which script)
- **Meter** - Unclear behavior (need more details)

### CONFIRMED WORKING:
- **Mute button** (v2.0.3) - Working correctly
- **Pan control** (v1.4.2) - Working correctly  
- **DB label** (v1.3.2) - OK
- **DB meter label** (v2.6.1) - OK

## Fader Fix Details

### Problem Found:
1. TouchOSC doesn't support `onValueChanged(valueName)` with parameters
2. Send control detection added unnecessary complexity
3. Movement scaling was completely removed

### Solution Applied:
1. Reverted to `onValueChanged()` without parameters
2. Removed all send control code
3. Restored movement scaling from main branch
4. Kept performance optimizations

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Fader Fix
Please test the fader:
- Does it respond to touch?
- Does it move smoothly?
- Does it sync with Ableton?
- Does double-tap to 0dB work?

### 2. Identify Status Indicator
Need to find which script controls the status indicator:
- Check template for object name
- Could be part of group_init.lua
- Might be a separate script

### 3. Clarify Meter Issues
What exactly is wrong with the meter?
- Visual display issues?
- Value accuracy problems?
- Color changes not working?

## Testing Needed

Please reload the template and test:
```
1. Fader movement and response
2. Check console for version: "FADER Script v2.6.1 loaded"
3. Note any error messages
4. Describe status indicator location/purpose
```

## State Saved: 2025-07-04 14:46 UTC
**Status**: Fader fixed with v2.6.1 - awaiting test results
**Next Action**: Test fader functionality
**Key Fix**: Corrected onValueChanged() signature for TouchOSC compatibility
