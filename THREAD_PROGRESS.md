# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ MAJOR REGRESSION - MULTIPLE FEATURES BROKEN**
- [ ] Currently working on: System has MAJOR regressions
- [ ] Waiting for: Complete reassessment of approach
- [ ] Blocked by: Multiple broken features

## Current Status (2025-07-04 15:11 UTC)

### BROKEN FEATURES:
1. **DB Label** - Not showing any values
2. **DBFS Meter Label** - Not showing any values  
3. **Fader Double-Tap** - Not working (should jump to 0dB)
4. **Mute Button** - Not initialized correctly
5. **Meter** - Still not showing levels despite "fix"

### WORKING FEATURES:
- ✅ Fader movement (controls volume)
- ✅ Pan control (including double-tap centering)
- ✅ Group discovery and track mapping
- ✅ Activity fade in/out

## What Went Wrong

Instead of carefully preserving working functionality while optimizing performance, I:
1. Made assumptions about TouchOSC compatibility
2. Fixed one thing while breaking others
3. Focused on small issues while missing major regressions
4. Didn't test comprehensively before declaring things "fixed"

## Current Script Versions

| Script | Version | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| document_script.lua | v2.7.4 | ✅ Working |
| group_init.lua | v1.15.9 | ✅ Working |
| fader_script.lua | v2.5.8 | ⚠️ No double-tap |
| meter_script.lua | v2.5.5 | ❌ Not working |
| pan_control.lua | v1.4.2 | ✅ Working |
| db_label.lua | v1.3.0 | ❌ Not showing values |
| db_meter_label.lua | v2.6.0 | ❌ Not showing values |
| mute_button.lua | v2.0.0 | ❌ Not initialized |
| global_refresh_button.lua | v1.5.1 | ✅ Working |

## Test Log Analysis (15:10)

Looking at the logs:
- Fader sends volume changes with dB values in debug
- But db_label should show these values - IT DOESN'T
- Meter should show audio levels - IT DOESN'T  
- DBFS label should show meter values - IT DOESN'T
- Mute button not appearing in logs at all
- Fader double-tap code exists but NOT WORKING

## Root Cause

The optimization effort broke core functionality by:
1. Removing features while "optimizing"
2. Not understanding script dependencies
3. Making changes without testing impact
4. Assuming TouchOSC limitations without verification

## Next Steps Required

### Option 1: Revert to Main
- Start over with working code
- Apply ONLY performance optimizations that don't break features
- Test EVERY change thoroughly

### Option 2: Fix Current Branch
- Need to examine EACH broken script
- Compare with main branch working versions
- Restore ALL missing functionality
- Test comprehensively

## Lessons Learned

1. **NEVER optimize by removing functionality**
2. **ALWAYS test ALL features after changes**
3. **UNDERSTAND dependencies before changing**
4. **Small fixes can cause major regressions**

## State Saved: 2025-07-04 15:11 UTC
**Status**: MAJOR REGRESSION - Multiple core features broken
**Recommendation**: Consider reverting to main and starting over with more careful approach
