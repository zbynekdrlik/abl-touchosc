# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Group init script updated to v1.14.1 - fixed Observer errors
- [x] Both regular and return tracks ARE mapping successfully (confirmed by logs)
- [x] Added tracking for active listeners to prevent stop errors
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test v1.14.1 and confirm status indicators work

## Latest Fix Applied

### Version 1.14.1 Changes:
1. **Fixed "Observer not connected" errors** - Only stop listeners that were previously started
2. **Added `listenersActive` flag** - Tracks when listeners are actually active
3. **Enhanced status indicator updates** - Added explicit `update()` call for visual refresh
4. **Better nil checking** - Ensure trackNumber is not nil before operations

## Testing Results From User Logs

### ‚úÖ What's Actually Working:
1. **Regular track detection** - `master_CG #` maps to track 4 correctly
2. **Return track detection** - `master_A-Repro LR #` maps to return 0 correctly
3. **OSC communication** - Both track types receive correct commands
4. **Script initialization** - Both scripts load v1.14.0 successfully

### üîß What Was Fixed:
1. **Observer errors** - Prevented by tracking active listeners
2. **Visual update issue** - Force indicator update after mapping

## Key Findings From Debug Logs

### Successful Mapping Confirmed:
```
[15:11:31] CONTROL(master_CG #) Mapped to Regular Track 4
[15:11:31] CONTROL(master_A-Repro LR #) Mapped to Return Track 0
```

### OSC Messages Working:
- `/live/song/get/return_track_names` returns: `STRING(A-Repro LR #)`
- Both tracks start their listeners correctly
- Volume and meter data received for regular track

### Error Pattern Fixed:
- "Observer not connected" errors when stopping non-existent listeners
- Fixed by only stopping listeners that were previously started

## Implementation Status
- Phase: TESTING VISUAL INDICATORS
- Step: Verifying status indicator updates work for both track types
- Status: Core functionality working, visual feedback being verified

## Code Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:
1. **group_init.lua v1.14.1**:
   - Fixed observer errors
   - Enhanced status indicator updates
   - Both track types mapping correctly
   - Proper listener management

### üîß Needs Testing:
- Visual status indicator updates (should turn green when mapped)
- Confirm no more "Observer not connected" errors

### ‚ùå Pending:
- Child script updates (waiting until visual confirmation)
- Old return implementation removal
- Documentation updates

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-03 13:15
- Action: Provided debug logs showing successful mapping but visual issue
- Result: Both tracks map, but status indicator issue identified
- Next Required: Test v1.14.1 and confirm visual indicators work

## Next Steps
1. **User should reload TouchOSC template** with v1.14.1
2. **Test both track types again**
3. **Confirm:**
   - Status indicators turn green when mapped
   - No "Observer not connected" errors
   - All controls work for both track types
4. **If successful**, proceed with child script updates

## Technical Notes
- Both track types ARE mapping successfully in the logs
- The issue was likely visual update timing
- Observer errors were from stopping non-existent listeners
- Solution: Track listener state and force visual updates

## Questions Resolved
1. ‚úÖ Return tracks ARE being detected correctly
2. ‚úÖ OSC communication is working properly
3. ‚úÖ The forked AbletonOSC is functioning as expected
4. ‚ùì Visual indicators should now update properly - needs confirmation
