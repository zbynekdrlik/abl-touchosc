## Implementation Status
- Phase: Feature Development - dB Meter Display
- Step: Script created and ready for testing
- Status: IMPLEMENTING

## Feature: Add dBFS Meter Display Based on Track Output
Creating a proper peak dBFS meter that shows actual audio level from track output meter.

### Background
- Previous LUFS implementation was fundamentally flawed
- LUFS cannot be calculated from simple peak meter values
- LUFS requires frequency weighting, time integration, and complex algorithms
- AbletonOSC output_meter_level provides normalized peak values
- Ableton uses 32-bit floating-point processing allowing signals > 0 dBFS internally

### Requirements
- Display peak dBFS value based on actual audio output level
- Update in real-time with audio meter
- Show appropriate dBFS range (typically -∞ to +60 dBFS)
- Handle Ableton's floating-point headroom (values > 0 dBFS)
- Use exact same calibration as meter script for accuracy
- Integrate with existing multi-connection routing
- Display format: "-12.5 dBFS" or "-∞ dBFS" for silence

### Implementation Details
The script:
- Listens to `/live/track/get/output_meter_level` (same as meter)
- Uses EXACT calibration points from meter_script.lua
- Converts normalized values → fader position → audio value → dBFS
- **NEW**: Handles values > 1.0 from AbletonOSC (floating-point headroom)
- Displays with proper formatting:
  - "-∞ dBFS" for silence or very low levels
  - "±X.X dBFS" for normal levels (e.g., "-12.5 dBFS", "+3.2 dBFS")
  - Can show values like "+12.5 dBFS" when tracks clip internally
  - Logs "[CLIPPING]" warning when > 0 dBFS
- Updates only when change > 0.1 dB to reduce flicker
- Shows "-∞ dBFS" if no data received for 2 seconds

### Key Differences from LUFS Attempt
- Based on actual peak levels, not perceptual loudness
- Direct mathematical conversion, no arbitrary offsets
- Accurate representation of what the meter shows
- No false averaging or time integration
- Proper unit notation: dBFS (decibels relative to Full Scale)
- Handles Ableton's 32-bit float headroom correctly

### Technical Discovery
From Ableton's manual: "Because of the enormous headroom of Live's 32-bit floating point audio engine, Live's meters can be driven far 'into the red' without causing the signals to clip. The only time that signals over 0 dB will be problematic is when routing to or from physical inputs and outputs."

This means:
- Internal tracks can exceed 0 dBFS without distortion
- True clipping only occurs at hardware I/O or file export
- Our meter can and should display these "over" values

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| db_meter_label.lua | ✅ v1.1.0 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-02
- Action: Pointed out Ableton can show values above 0dB
- Result: Researched and updated script to handle floating-point headroom
- Next Required: Add dB meter label to TouchOSC interface

## Script Versions - Feature Branch
| Script | Version | Status |
|--------|---------|---------|
| db_meter_label.lua | 1.1.0 | ✅ Handles floating-point headroom |

### Version History
- v1.0.0: Initial implementation with standard dBFS range
- v1.0.1: Updated to use proper "dBFS" unit notation
- v1.1.0: Extended to handle Ableton's floating-point headroom (> 0 dBFS)

## TouchOSC Integration Steps Required
User needs to:
1. Open TouchOSC editor
2. Add a new Label control to each track group
3. Name it exactly: `db_meter_label`
4. Position it near the existing meter
5. Attach the `db_meter_label.lua` script to it
6. Set OSC receive pattern: `/live/track/get/output_meter_level`
7. Size label to fit text like "-12.5 dBFS" (10-11 characters)
8. Test with actual audio playback

## Configuration
- No configuration changes required
- dBFS meter label uses same connection routing as meter
- Works with existing track mapping system

## Technical Notes
- Uses exact calibration from meter_script.lua for accuracy
- Conversion chain: OSC value → fader position → audio value → dBFS
- Same mathematical functions as fader for consistency
- Peak meter values, not RMS or integrated loudness
- dBFS = decibels relative to Full Scale
- Handles values > 1.0 from AbletonOSC (32-bit float headroom)
- Can display positive dBFS values when tracks clip internally

## Next Steps
1. User adds dB meter label control to TouchOSC
2. Test dBFS display with audio playback
3. Test with hot signals to verify positive dBFS display
4. Verify dBFS values match Ableton's peak indicators
5. Fine-tune update threshold if needed
6. Update documentation
