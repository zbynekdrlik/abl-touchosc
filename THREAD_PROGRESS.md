# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ NEW FEATURE IN PROGRESS:**
- [ ] Currently working on: Fader position color indicator
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing of textColor property
- [ ] Blocked by: Finding correct property for label text color

## Implementation Status
- Phase: NEW FEATURE - FADER POSITION COLOR INDICATOR
- Step: Troubleshooting color property application
- Status: IMPLEMENTING/DEBUGGING
- Branch: feature/fader-position-color-indicator

## New Feature: Fader Position Color Indicator (v1.4.4)
**Feature Request:** Change db_label color when fader is not at 0dB position

**Implementation Progress:**
- v1.4.0: Initial implementation with gray default color
- v1.4.1: Changed default color to white for better contrast
- v1.4.2: Removed tolerance, changed to subtle off-white
- v1.4.3: Tried using self.label.color property
- v1.4.4: Currently trying self.textColor property

**Current Issue:**
- Logs show correct behavior but color is not visually changing
- Trying to find correct property path for label text color
- User indicated label has "label parameter and then parameter color"

**Properties Attempted:**
1. `self.color` - No visual change
2. `self.label.color` - No visual change
3. `self.textColor` - Currently testing

**Implementation Details:**
- White color (1, 1, 1) when exactly at 0dB
- Subtle cream/off-white (0.9, 0.9, 0.85) when moved from 0dB
- No tolerance - only exact 0dB shows white (< 0.01 for floating point)
- Clean implementation with no regression risk

**Files Modified:**
- scripts/track/db_label.lua (v1.3.2 → v1.4.4)

## Testing Status
- [x] Logic verified working via logs
- [ ] Visual color change not yet working
- [ ] Need to find correct property for label text color

## Previous Work (Completed)
### Feedback Loop Prevention (v2.5.4) ✅
**Issue:** When moving fader in Ableton:
1. Ableton sends OSC to TouchOSC to update fader position
2. TouchOSC receives and updates its fader (self.values.x)
3. This triggers onValueChanged() which sends OSC back to Ableton
4. Creates feedback loop making Ableton fader jumpy/laggy

**Solution:** Added `updating_from_osc` flag to prevent sending OSC when updating from received OSC:
- Set flag before updating self.values.x in onReceiveOSC()
- Check flag in onValueChanged() and skip sending if set
- Also set flag in update() function during sync operations

**Testing Result:** ✅ User confirmed fix is working - no more feedback loop!

## Next Steps
1. Test if self.textColor works
2. If not, may need to:
   - Check TouchOSC documentation for label text color property
   - Try alternative visual indicators (parent background color?)
   - Consider using two labels with visibility toggle
3. Once working, update documentation
4. Merge PR after successful testing

## Notes
- Simple, clean implementation focusing on visual feedback
- No changes to fader behavior or OSC communication
- Uses TouchOSC Color constructor as per rules
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- White/cream provides subtle visual contrast
- Issue appears to be finding correct property path for label text color
