# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Double-click mute feature COMPLETE (v2.4.0 - minimal implementation)
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing and feedback
- [ ] Blocked by: None
- **Thread ending - ready to continue in new thread**

## Implementation Status
- Phase: FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
- Step: Ready for user testing
- Status: AWAITING TEST RESULTS
- Branch: feature/double-click-mute
- PR: #24 (open) - https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/abl-touchosc/pull/24

## Feature Summary
**Double-click mute protection implemented with minimal changes:**
- ✅ mute_button.lua v2.4.0 - Minimal double-click detection (only 15 lines added)
- ✅ document_script.lua v2.9.0 - Updated documentation only
- ✅ README.md - Updated to v2.4.0
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md - Updated for v2.4.0 changes
- ✅ PR #24 updated - Minimal implementation complete

## Configuration Format (FINAL)
```yaml
# IMPORTANT: Each group needs its own line!
# Only instance-specific configuration is supported (no global option)

# Instance-specific (one group per line)
double_click_mute_band: 'Band Tracks'
double_click_mute_band: 'Lead Vocals'
double_click_mute_band: 'Drums'
double_click_mute_master: 'Master Bus'
double_click_mute_master: 'Critical'
```

## Session Summary (This Thread)
1. Started with request to remove global configuration option
2. Removed all references to `double_click_mute:` (global) from docs
3. Updated to v2.3.0 initially
4. Analyzed implementation and found it was overly complex (100+ lines)
5. Simplified to minimal implementation (v2.4.0) with only 15 lines added
6. Preserved ALL original button behavior - no regressions
7. Updated all documentation to reflect v2.4.0

## Technical Implementation Details
**Minimal changes made:**
- 2 new variables: `lastClickTime` and `requiresDoubleClick`
- 1 function: `updateDoubleClickConfig()` - simple pattern match
- 8 lines in `onValueChanged` - blocks first click if double-click required
- Configuration cached for performance (updates on track change)
- Original behavior completely preserved

**Key code addition:**
```lua
if self.values.x == 0 and requiresDoubleClick then
    local currentTime = getMillis()
    if currentTime - lastClickTime > 500 then
        lastClickTime = currentTime
        return  -- Skip first click
    end
    lastClickTime = 0  -- Reset
end
```

## What User Needs to Do Next
1. **Pull the feature branch**: `git pull && git checkout feature/double-click-mute`
2. **Update TouchOSC template** with new scripts
3. **Add configuration** for groups needing double-click protection
4. **Test the feature** thoroughly
5. **Provide feedback** on PR #24

## Testing Checklist for User
- [ ] Single-click works on non-configured tracks
- [ ] Double-click required on configured tracks
- [ ] 500ms timing feels natural
- [ ] Configuration parsing works correctly (instance-specific only)
- [ ] No regression on existing functionality
- [ ] Multiple instances work independently
- [ ] Configuration updates when track changes or refresh pressed
- [ ] Button state syncs properly with Ableton

## Next Thread Should:
1. Check if user has tested the feature
2. Review any test results/logs provided
3. Fix any issues found during testing
4. If tests pass:
   - Merge PR #24
   - Update version to v1.4.0
   - Create release tag
5. If issues found:
   - Debug and fix
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Re-test

## Important Notes for Next Thread:
- Feature uses MINIMAL implementation approach (not the complex v2.3.0)
- Configuration is CACHED for performance
- Only instance-specific config supported (no global option)
- All original button behavior preserved
- 500ms double-click window (hardcoded, could be made configurable)
- Configuration updates on track change or refresh
