## Current Task: Restore Pan Control Features
**Started**: 2025-07-05  
**Branch**: feature/restore-pan-functionality
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
**PR**: #17 - Ready for testing

### Problem Identified:
User reported that pan button lost its color change and double touch functionality between versions.

### Solution Implemented:
Restored missing functionality in pan_control.lua v1.6.0:
1. ✅ **Color change based on pan position**:
   - Gray when centered (within 0.02 tolerance)
   - Yellow when panned left or right
   - Uses `updateVisualState()` function
2. ✅ **Double touch to center**:
   - Double tap detection with 500ms timeout
   - Smooth animation back to center
   - Animation speed configurable

### Testing Required:
- [ ] Pan control shows gray when centered
- [ ] Pan control shows yellow when panned
- [ ] Double touch centers pan smoothly
- [ ] Works with regular tracks
- [ ] Works with return tracks
- [ ] No performance impact
