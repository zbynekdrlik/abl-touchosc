# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fixed fader script connection routing error (v2.2.0)
- [ ] Currently testing: band_CG # group with fader
- [ ] Waiting for: User to reload TouchOSC with updated fader script and test
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: 3 - Script Functionality Testing
- Step: Testing fader control on band_CG # group
- Status: TESTING
- Date: 2025-06-28

## Current Testing Progress
### band_CG # Group Setup
- ✅ Group created with status indicator
- ✅ Group script v1.7.0 attached
- ✅ OSC receive pattern set
- ✅ Successfully mapped to Track 39
- ✅ Status indicator GREEN
- ✅ Controls enabled (5 controls)

### Fader Control
- ✅ Fader added to group
- ✅ OSC receive pattern set (/live/track/get/volume)
- ❌ Had error: "No such property or function: 'getConnectionForInstance'"
- ✅ Fixed in v2.2.0 - now reads config directly
- ⏳ Needs testing with new version

## Script Versions
- **document_script.lua**: v2.5.9 ✅ (centralized logging working)
- **group_init.lua**: v1.7.0 ✅ (tested and working)
- **global_refresh_button.lua**: v1.4.0 ✅ (tested and working)
- **fader_script.lua**: v2.2.0 ✅ (JUST UPDATED - needs testing)
- **meter_script.lua**: v2.1.0 ❌ (not tested)
- **mute_button.lua**: v1.1.0 ❌ (not tested)
- **pan_control.lua**: v1.1.0 ❌ (not tested)

## Key Fix Applied
The fader script was trying to call functions from the document script, which is impossible in TouchOSC due to script isolation. Fixed by:
1. Removed attempt to call `documentScript.getConnectionForInstance()`
2. Added local `getConnectionIndex()` function that reads configuration directly
3. Now parses parent's tag and reads config text just like group script does

## Next Steps
1. User needs to reload TouchOSC with updated fader script (v2.2.0)
2. Test fader functionality:
   - Check version logged as v2.2.0
   - Move fader and verify volume changes
   - Check logs for proper operation
   - Verify OSC sent to connection 2 only
3. Once fader works, add and test remaining controls:
   - Meter display
   - Mute button
   - Pan control

## Configuration Reminder
Current real-world configuration:
```
connection_band: 2
connection_master: 3
```

## Testing Checklist for band_CG #
- [x] Group initializes correctly
- [x] Refresh maps track successfully
- [ ] Fader controls volume (v2.2.0 needs testing)
- [ ] Meter shows levels
- [ ] Mute button works
- [ ] Pan control works
- [ ] All logs use centralized logging
- [ ] No cross-talk with other connections

## Summary
We've identified and fixed the script isolation issue. The fader script now properly reads the configuration directly instead of trying to call functions from other scripts. Ready to continue testing once the user reloads with the updated script.
