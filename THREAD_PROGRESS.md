## Current Task: Fix Refresh Track Renumbering - COMPLETE
**Started**: 2025-07-05
**Branch**: feature/fix-refresh-track-renumbering  
**Status**: READY_FOR_MERGE
**PR**: #15 - Ready to merge

### Solution Summary:
Implemented a registration system where track groups self-register with the document script during initialization. This avoids the issues with searching TouchOSC's control hierarchy and ensures refresh works regardless of tag changes.

### Final Changes:
1. ✅ **group_init.lua v1.16.2**:
   - Each group registers itself with document script on init
   - Properly handles clear_mapping and refresh_tracks
   - Resets tag and notifies children on clear

2. ✅ **document_script.lua v2.8.7**:
   - Maintains registry of track groups
   - No searching required - groups self-register
   - 100ms delay between clear and refresh operations
   - DEBUG = 0 for production

3. ✅ **fader_script.lua v2.5.3**:
   - Handles mapping_cleared notification
   - Cancels animations when mapping is cleared
   - Always reads fresh track info from parent tag

### Testing Results:
- ✅ Groups register successfully on startup
- ✅ Refresh finds and clears all groups (not 0)
- ✅ Track renumbering works correctly (track 7 → track 6 confirmed)
- ✅ Faders control correct tracks after refresh
- ✅ No controls stuck on wrong tracks

### Production Ready:
- ✅ All scripts have DEBUG = 0
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md updated
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ PR description updated
- ✅ Testing successful
