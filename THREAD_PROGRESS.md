# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ PR #28 IN PROGRESS:**
- [ ] Currently working on: Waiting for user to test with detailed logging v1.17.2
- [ ] Waiting for: User to run refresh and provide logs showing track names received vs expected
- [ ] Blocked by: Need diagnostic logs to identify track name mismatch

## ACTIVE WORK: ANDROID TABLET REFRESH ISSUE - DIAGNOSTICS ADDED
### Problem Evolution:
1. Initially thought it was timing issue on slower tablets
2. Tried various delays (50ms, 150ms, 500ms, 2s)
3. User discovered the real issue: Groups can't find matching track names in received list
4. Example: Group "band_STEVO repro#" looking for track "STEVO repro#" - not found

### Solution Implemented:
1. **500ms delay**: ✅ (but doesn't fix the real issue)
   - `document_script.lua` v2.13.1 - Simple timing approach
2. **Detailed logging**: ✅ NEW
   - `group_init.lua` v1.17.2 - Logs all track names received with lengths
   - Will show exact mismatch between expected vs received names

### Next Steps:
1. User needs to test with v1.17.2 and provide logs
2. Analyze logs to see track name differences (extra spaces, special chars, etc.)
3. Implement fix based on findings

## COMPLETED WORK: PR #26 MERGED
### Duplicate Track Names Fix: COMPLETE
- [x] Centralized track names retrieval MERGED
- [x] Prevents duplicate OSC calls during refresh
- [x] Version 2.10.0 released

## COMPLETED WORK: DOUBLE-CLICK MUTE (PR #24)
### Final Status: READY FOR MERGE
- [x] Double-click mute protection COMPLETE AND WORKING
- [x] Documentation cleanup COMPLETE
- [x] Experimental files removed
- [x] README fully documented with two-control approach
- [x] CHANGELOG finalized for v1.5.0
- [x] Ready for merge

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| document_script v2.13.1 | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| group_init v1.17.2 | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-10 13:45
- Action: Added detailed logging to group_init.lua v1.17.2
- Result: Ready for user to test and provide diagnostic logs
- Next Required: User to run refresh and share logs showing track names

## NEXT STEPS
1. Wait for user to test with new logging
2. Analyze logs to identify track name mismatch
3. Fix based on findings (trim spaces, handle special chars, etc.)
4. Test on Android tablet again
5. If working, merge PR #28
6. Then merge PR #24 (double-click mute)
7. Create v1.5.0 release
