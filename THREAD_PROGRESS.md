# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fixed all fader script issues (v2.3.3)
- [x] Fader working correctly with Ableton
- [x] Updated meter script with multi-connection support (v2.2.1)
- [x] Meter WORKING - showing correct levels and colors
- [x] Fixed group script visual corruption issue (v1.9.0)
- [ ] Currently: Ready to test meter with updated group script
- [ ] Waiting for: User to reload and confirm visual appearance is preserved
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: 3 - Script Functionality Testing
- Step: Testing individual controls on band_CG # group
- Status: TESTING
- Date: 2025-06-28

## Current Testing Progress
### band_CG # Group Setup
- ✅ Group created with status indicator
- ✅ Group script v1.9.0 attached (no visual changes)
- ✅ OSC receive pattern set
- ✅ Successfully mapped to Track 39
- ✅ Status indicator GREEN
- ✅ Controls enabled (5 controls)

### Fader Control
- ✅ Fader added to group
- ✅ OSC receive pattern set (/live/track/get/volume)
- ✅ Fixed: Connection routing (v2.2.0)
- ✅ Fixed: OSC receive tag format (v2.3.1)
- ✅ Fixed: OSC send missing volume parameter (v2.3.2)
- ✅ Fixed: Volume logs moved to debug mode (v2.3.3)
- ✅ FULLY WORKING with all sophisticated features

### Meter Control
- ✅ Script updated to v2.2.1 (with debug logging)
- ✅ Preserves exact calibration from working meter
- ✅ Multi-connection support added
- ✅ WORKING - receiving data, showing 72.9% (0dB) with red color
- ✅ Connection filtering working correctly

### Group Script Issue
- ❌ v1.7.0 was changing control colors/opacity
- ✅ FIXED in v1.9.0 - now only toggles interactivity
- ✅ No more visual corruption of controls

### Remaining Controls to Test
- ⏳ Mute button - Not tested
- ⏳ Pan control - Not tested

## Critical Issues Fixed in This Thread

### 1. Script Isolation Issue
**Problem**: Fader tried to call `documentScript.getConnectionForInstance()`
**Solution**: Scripts are completely isolated in TouchOSC - each script must read config directly
**Fixed in**: v2.2.0

### 2. Tag Format Change
**Problem**: Group script now uses "instance:track" format (e.g., "band:39") but fader expected just "39"
**Solution**: Extract track number from new format in onReceiveOSC
**Fixed in**: v2.3.1

### 3. OSC Send Parameter Issue
**Problem**: Fader only sent track number without volume value
**Solution**: Fixed sendOSCRouted to properly send both parameters
**Fixed in**: v2.3.2

### 4. Logger Verbosity
**Problem**: Volume changes spamming the logger
**Solution**: Moved volume change logs to debug mode only
**Fixed in**: v2.3.3

### 5. Visual Corruption Issue
**Problem**: Group script was changing control colors/opacity when enabling/disabling
**Solution**: Removed ALL visual changes, only toggle interactivity
**Fixed in**: v1.9.0

## Script Versions
- **document_script.lua**: v2.5.9 ✅ (centralized logging working)
- **group_init.lua**: v1.9.0 ✅ (fixed visual corruption)
- **global_refresh_button.lua**: v1.4.0 ✅ (tested and working)
- **fader_script.lua**: v2.3.3 ✅ (FULLY TESTED AND WORKING)
- **meter_script.lua**: v2.2.1 ✅ (TESTED AND WORKING)
- **mute_button.lua**: v1.1.0 ❌ (not tested)
- **pan_control.lua**: v1.1.0 ❌ (not tested)

## Key Learnings

### TouchOSC Script Isolation
1. Scripts CANNOT share variables or functions
2. Each script must be completely self-contained
3. Communication only via:
   - `notify()` - for messages between scripts
   - Parent/child properties
   - Reading shared controls (like configuration text)

### Configuration Pattern
Scripts that need connection info must:
1. Find the configuration control: `root:findByName("configuration", true)`
2. Parse the text directly
3. Cannot rely on helper functions from other scripts

### OSC Patterns
- Send format: `/path/to/command track_number value connection_table`
- Receive must handle exact format expected by Ableton
- Connection routing requires explicit connection table

### Visual Design Preservation
- Group script should ONLY toggle interactivity
- Never change colors or opacity of controls
- Status indicator is sufficient for visual feedback
- Preserve user's carefully tuned appearance

## Next Steps
1. User reloads TouchOSC with group script v1.9.0
2. Verify visual appearance is preserved
3. Continue testing meter with audio at different levels
4. Add and test mute button
5. Add and test pan control
6. Create master_Hand1 # group
7. Test multi-instance routing

## Configuration Reminder
Current real-world configuration:
```
connection_band: 2
connection_master: 3
```

## Testing Checklist for band_CG #
- [x] Group initializes correctly
- [x] Refresh maps track successfully
- [x] Fader controls volume
- [x] Meter shows levels with correct calibration
- [x] Meter responds only to connection_band messages
- [x] Meter colors match dB thresholds
- [ ] Visual appearance preserved after refresh
- [ ] Mute button works
- [ ] Pan control works
- [x] All logs use centralized logging
- [x] No cross-talk with other connections

## Summary
Major progress! Both fader and meter are working with multi-connection routing. Fixed visual corruption issue in group script. Ready to verify appearance is preserved and continue with remaining controls.
