# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è DEBUGGING IN PROGRESS - DEBUG = 1 ENABLED**
- [x] Fixed: Group discovery mechanism in document_script.lua 
- [x] Enabled: DEBUG = 1 in all key scripts for troubleshooting
- [ ] Currently working on: Debugging why groups aren't being found/refreshed
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing with debug output
- [ ] Blocked by: Need to see debug logs to understand why track discovery isn't working

## Current Status (2025-07-04)

### Debug Mode Enabled (Just Now)
1. **document_script.lua** (v2.7.2 ‚Üí v2.7.3)
   - Fixed: Group discovery mechanism to find groups by name pattern
   - Added: DEBUG = 1 with comprehensive debug logging
   - Changed: Now searches for groups with names starting with "master_" or "band_"

2. **group_init.lua** (v1.15.6 ‚Üí v1.15.7)
   - Added: DEBUG = 1 for detailed track discovery logging
   - Will show: All OSC messages received, track names, connection details

3. **fader_script.lua** (v2.5.5 ‚Üí v2.5.6)
   - Added: DEBUG = 1 for fader operation logging

4. **meter_script.lua** (v2.5.2 ‚Üí v2.5.3)
   - Added: DEBUG = 1 for meter level logging

### Key Issue Found
- Document script was looking for groups with tag "trackGroup"
- Groups don't set this tag - they use name patterns
- Fixed to find groups by name pattern (master_* or band_*)

### Previous Fixes Still Active
All previous fixes from Rounds 1-4 are still in place:
- Track discovery mechanism restored
- Property errors fixed
- Schedule() method replaced with time-based checks
- Fader position checks removed
- Event-driven meter updates

## Implementation Status - PERFORMANCE
- Phase: 1 of 4 - Quick Wins + Critical Fix + Complete Script Coverage
- Step: DEBUGGING why track discovery isn't working
- Status: AWAITING USER TEST WITH DEBUG OUTPUT

## Testing Status Matrix - DEBUGGING
| Component | Version | DEBUG | Expected Debug Output |
|-----------|---------|-------|----------------------|
| document_script | v2.7.3 | ‚úÖ ON | Group discovery, refresh calls |
| group_init | v1.15.7 | ‚úÖ ON | Track names, mapping process |
| fader_script | v2.5.6 | ‚úÖ ON | Fader movements, OSC messages |
| meter_script | v2.5.3 | ‚úÖ ON | Meter levels, updates |
| Others | Various | OFF | Normal operation |

## Debug Output Expected

### On Startup:
```
Document Script v2.7.3
[DEBUG]: Found group: master_A-Repro LR #
[DEBUG]: Found 1 groups total
=== AUTOMATIC STARTUP REFRESH ===
[DEBUG]: Refreshing 1 groups
[DEBUG]: Refreshing group: master_A-Repro LR #
```

### From Groups:
```
GROUP(master_A-Repro LR #): Received notify: refresh_tracks
GROUP(master_A-Repro LR #): Received track names, checking for: A-Repro LR #
GROUP(master_A-Repro LR #): Track 0: [actual track names from Ableton]
```

## Next Steps

### 1. User Testing Required üéØ
1. **Update all scripts with DEBUG versions**
2. **Restart TouchOSC**
3. **Connect to Ableton Live**
4. **Copy ALL console output**
5. **Look for**:
   - How many groups are found
   - What track names are received
   - Any error messages
   - Connection issues

### 2. What to Check in Logs:
- Does document script find the group?
- Does refresh get triggered?
- Does group receive track names from Ableton?
- Are track names matching?

### 3. Potential Issues to Watch For:
- Connection not established
- Track names not matching exactly
- Wrong connection index
- OSC messages not being received

## Technical Notes

### Group Discovery Change:
- OLD: `root:findAllByProperty("tag", "trackGroup", true)`
- NEW: Custom search for controls with names matching "master_*" or "band_*"
- This should find all track groups properly

### Debug Logging Added:
- Configuration parsing
- Group discovery process  
- Notify message flow
- Track name matching
- Connection handling

## Branch Status

- Implementation: ‚úÖ Complete
- Bug fixes: ‚úÖ Complete (4 rounds)
- Debug mode: ‚úÖ Enabled
- Documentation: ‚úÖ Updated
- Testing: ‚ùå Awaiting debug logs
- **Ready for merge: No** (debugging in progress)

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Group discovery by name** - More reliable than tag property
2. **Comprehensive debug logging** - To trace exact failure point
3. **DEBUG = 1 temporarily** - Will revert to 0 after fixing
4. **Focus on critical path** - Document ‚Üí Group ‚Üí Track discovery

## Last Actions
- Fixed group discovery mechanism in document script
- Enabled DEBUG = 1 in all critical scripts
- Ready for user to test and provide debug logs
- Once we see logs, we can identify exact issue
