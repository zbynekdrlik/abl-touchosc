## Version 1.2.0 Release Summary

### What Was Implemented:
1. **Unified Architecture** - Same scripts handle both track types
2. **Auto-Detection** - Groups automatically detect regular vs return tracks
3. **Smart Track Labels** - First word display with return prefix handling (A-, B-, etc.)
4. **Full Feature Parity** - All controls work identically for both track types
5. **Bug Fixes** - Property access errors and label truncation issues resolved

### Key Technical Details:
- Parent groups store track info in tag: "instance:trackNumber:trackType"
- Child scripts parse parent tag to determine OSC paths
- Return tracks use `/live/return/` namespace
- Regular tracks use `/live/track/` namespace

### Testing Confirmed:
- ✅ Return track detection and mapping
- ✅ All controls working bidirectionally  
- ✅ OSC data flow (meter values, dB updates)
- ✅ Smart label display
- ✅ No script errors

## Documentation Updates Complete

### Updated Files:
1. **CHANGELOG.md** - Added v1.2.0 release notes
2. **README.md** - Updated to reflect unified architecture
3. **PR Description** - Current and accurate

- Removed references to separate return scripts
- Explained auto-detection mechanism
- Added smart label behavior description
- Updated script version table
