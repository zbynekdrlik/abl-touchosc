# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] AbletonOSC forked and return track support implemented
- [x] Pull request created: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC/pull/2
- [ ] **Currently working on**: Waiting for user to test the forked AbletonOSC
- [ ] **Waiting for**: User to install forked AbletonOSC and test return track functionality
- [ ] **Next step**: After testing, implement TouchOSC templates for return tracks

## Implementation Status
- Phase: 1 - Core Implementation (AbletonOSC Fork)
- Step: Testing forked AbletonOSC with return track support
- Status: IMPLEMENTED - WAITING FOR TESTING

## AbletonOSC Fork Details
- Fork repository: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC
- Branch: feature/return-tracks-support
- PR: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC/pull/2

### Changes Made:
1. **song.py**: Added return track handlers
   - `/live/song/get/num_return_tracks`
   - `/live/song/get/return_track_names`
   - `/live/song/get/return_track_data`

2. **track.py**: Added complete `/live/return/` namespace
   - All property getters/setters
   - Mixer controls (volume, panning)
   - Send controls
   - Device queries
   - Clip operations
   - Output routing

3. **Documentation**: Created RETURN_TRACK_SUPPORT.md

## Testing Instructions for User
1. **Install the forked AbletonOSC**:
   - Download from: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC/tree/feature/return-tracks-support
   - Replace existing AbletonOSC installation
   - Restart Ableton Live

2. **Test basic functionality**:
   ```
   # Get number of return tracks
   /live/song/get/num_return_tracks
   
   # Get return track names
   /live/song/get/return_track_names
   
   # Control first return track
   /live/return/get/volume 0
   /live/return/set/volume 0 0.75
   ```

3. **Provide test results showing**:
   - Return tracks are now accessible
   - Basic controls work (volume, mute, solo)
   - No errors or crashes

## Next Steps After Testing
1. If AbletonOSC fork works: Implement TouchOSC templates
2. If issues found: Fix in fork and re-test
3. Consider submitting PR to upstream ideoforms/AbletonOSC

## Original Investigation
- Confirmed AbletonOSC limitation (no return track support)
- Root cause: Only exposes `song.tracks`, not `song.return_tracks`
- Solution: Fork and add proper implementation
- Documentation: `docs/abletonosc-return-track-issue.md`
