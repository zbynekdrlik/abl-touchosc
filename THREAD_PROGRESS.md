## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è FADER PARTIALLY WORKING - MORE FIXES NEEDED**
- [x] Currently working on: Fixed meter notification spam in v2.5.7
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test if meter spam is reduced
- [ ] Blocked by: Need to verify fader actually controls Ableton volume

## Current Status (2025-07-04 15:34 UTC)

### JUST FIXED:
- **Meter Script v2.5.7** - Fixed excessive notification spam:
  - **PROBLEM**: Meter was notifying parent on EVERY update (multiple times/second)
  - **EFFECT**: Constant "value_changed = meter" spam in logs
  - **SOLUTION**: Added throttling - only notify on >5% changes with 100ms minimum interval
  - Also fixed potential boolean concat issues with tostring()

### Previously Fixed:
- **Fader Script v2.6.4** - Fixed boolean concat runtime error
  - But user reports fader still doesn't control Ableton volume!

### REMAINING ISSUES:
- **Fader** - May not be sending volume to Ableton properly
- **Status indicator** - Not working at all (need to identify which script)
- **Other scripts** - Need to check for similar boolean concat issues

### CONFIRMED WORKING:
- **Mute button** (v2.0.3) - Working correctly
- **Pan control** (v1.4.2) - Working correctly  
- **DB label** (v1.3.2) - OK
- **DB meter label** (v2.6.1) - OK

## Key Issues Found

### 1. Meter Notification Spam
The meter was sending notifications to the parent group on EVERY meter update, causing:
- Hundreds of "value_changed = meter" messages per second
- Performance impact from excessive notifications
- Cluttered logs making debugging difficult

Fixed by adding:
- 5% change threshold before notifying
- 100ms minimum interval between notifications

### 2. Boolean Concatenation Errors
Found in multiple scripts where boolean/nil values weren't converted to strings:
- Fader: `debugPrint("In linear range:", in_linear_range)` 
- Meter: `debug("Track Type:", trackType, ...)` when trackType could be nil

### 3. Fader Not Controlling Ableton
User reports fader moves in logs but doesn't control Ableton volume. Need to investigate:
- Is OSC message format correct?
- Is connection routing working?
- Is the audio value calculation correct?

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Meter Fix
Please reload and check if meter spam is reduced:
```
Should see far fewer "value_changed = meter" messages
Meter should still update visually
Performance should be better
```

### 2. Debug Fader Control
Need to verify fader is actually sending to Ableton:
- Check if OSC messages are being sent
- Verify connection routing is correct
- Test with OSC monitor if available

### 3. Check Other Scripts
Still need to check for boolean concat issues in:
- group_init.lua
- global_refresh_button.lua

## State Saved: 2025-07-04 15:34 UTC
**Status**: Fixed meter spam, but fader still not controlling Ableton
**Next Action**: Test meter fix and debug fader OSC sending
**Key Learning**: Debug logging can introduce its own bugs!
