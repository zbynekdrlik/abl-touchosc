# Thread Progress Tracking

## Current Status
- **Phase**: 3 - Script Functionality Testing
- **Step**: Reviewing scripts and preparing single track test
- **Date**: 2025-06-28
- **Branch**: feature/selective-connection-routing

## Important Context
- Document script (v2.5.8) tested and working
- Configuration and logger objects working perfectly
- Notify system implemented and tested
- Global refresh button (v1.2.1) working with proper logging
- **Test track changed to**: "band_CG #"
- All track scripts reviewed for TouchOSC compliance

## Phase 3 Progress

### Setup Phase
- ✅ Configuration text object (working)
- ✅ Logger text object (working - shows messages correctly)
- ✅ Document script attached to root (v2.5.8)
- ✅ Notify system tested (refresh_all_groups notification works)
- ✅ Global refresh button (v1.2.1) - Working with proper logging
- ✅ Single track complete test instructions created
- ✅ Updated test track to "band_CG #"
- ✅ Reviewed all track scripts for compliance
- [ ] Create ONE complete track group - READY TO TEST

### Script Review Results
All scripts follow TouchOSC rules and are ready for testing:
- **group_init.lua** (v1.5.1): Properly disables controls until mapped
- **fader_script.lua** (v2.0.0): Connection-aware, smooth operation
- **meter_script.lua** (v2.0.0): Filters by connection, visual feedback
- **mute_button.lua** (v1.0.0): Toggle with visual states
- **pan_control.lua** (v1.0.0): Center snap, proper range conversion

Key findings:
- All scripts use proper version logging
- Connection routing implemented correctly
- Safety checks prevent wrong track control
- Visual feedback for disabled states
- No violations of TouchOSC rules found

### Script Testing Phase (Single Group First)
- [ ] Test group script (band_CG #)
- [ ] Test fader script in group
- [ ] Test meter script in group
- [ ] Test mute button in group
- [ ] Test pan control in group
- [ ] Test all controls working together
- [ ] THEN test multiple group scenarios

## Current Task: Create Complete "band_CG #" Group
User needs to create ONE complete track group with:
1. Group container with status LED
2. Track label
3. Fader with script
4. Meter display with script
5. Mute button with script
6. Pan control with script

Detailed instructions in: `docs/single-track-complete-test.md`

## Script Versions Ready for Testing
- **document_script.lua**: v2.5.8 (updated)
- **group_init.lua**: v1.5.1 (safety features confirmed)
- **global_refresh_button.lua**: v1.2.1 (updated and working)
- **fader_script.lua**: v2.0.0 (connection-aware)
- **meter_script.lua**: v2.0.0 (connection filtering)
- **mute_button.lua**: v1.0.0 (visual states)
- **pan_control.lua**: v1.0.0 (center snap)

## Key Safety Features Confirmed
- Groups disable all controls until properly mapped
- Scripts check parent group mapping before sending OSC
- Connection routing prevents cross-talk
- Visual dimming shows disabled state
- Faders reset to 0 when unmapped

## Next Steps
1. User creates single complete band_CG # group
2. Test initialization of all scripts
3. Test refresh to map the track
4. Test each control individually
5. Test all controls working together
6. Once perfect, then create additional test groups
