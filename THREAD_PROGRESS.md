# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Systematic review of notify() usage
- [ ] Waiting for: Testing of db_meter_label changes (v2.8.0)
- [ ] Blocked by: None
- [ ] **ONGOING**: Reviewing other scripts for logging pattern updates

## Current Status (2025-07-04 21:31 UTC)

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: db_meter_label.lua Fixed (v2.8.0)

**Changes made:**
1. **Removed value_changed fallback** - The notify handler for "value_changed" has been completely removed
2. **Updated logging to centralized pattern** - Now uses `root:notify("log_message", ...)` as per TouchOSC rules
3. **Version bumped to 2.8.0** - Indicates significant fix

### üìã CLARIFICATION: log_message notify is CORRECT

After reviewing the TouchOSC rules (rule #11), the centralized logging pattern using `root:notify("log_message", ...)` is the CORRECT approach. The document script (v2.7.6) properly handles these notifications.

### üîç NOTIFY USAGE REVIEW STATUS:

1. **log_message** - ‚úÖ CORRECT (centralized logging pattern per rules)
   - Document script handles it properly
   - Scripts SHOULD use this pattern

2. **value_changed in db_meter_label** - ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Fallback removed in v2.8.0
   - Now relies only on direct OSC

3. **track_changed** - ‚úÖ NEEDED
   - Informs children when track mapping changes
   - Lightweight, essential for coordination

4. **track_type** - ‚úÖ NEEDED
   - Informs children whether track is regular or return
   - Essential for proper OSC path handling

5. **track_unmapped** - ‚úÖ NEEDED
   - Clears children when track is unmapped
   - Essential for state management

6. **child_touched/released** - ‚úÖ NEEDED
   - UI interaction notifications
   - Already reviewed in group_init.lua

7. **sibling_touched/released** - ‚úÖ NEEDED
   - Forwarded from child_touched/released
   - Essential for coordinated UI behavior

8. **refresh_all_groups** - ‚úÖ NEEDED
   - One-time trigger for track discovery
   - Essential for initialization

### üìù SCRIPTS TO UPDATE FOR LOGGING:

Need to check and update logging pattern in:
- [ ] fader_script.lua
- [ ] meter_script.lua
- [ ] mute_button.lua
- [ ] pan_control.lua
- [ ] db_label.lua
- [ ] group_init.lua (already uses local log, needs review)
- [ ] global_refresh_button.lua

### NEXT STEPS:
1. Wait for user to test db_meter_label v2.8.0
2. Update other scripts to use centralized logging
3. Verify all scripts follow TouchOSC rules properly
4. Update README if needed
