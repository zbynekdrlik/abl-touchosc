# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ INVESTIGATING TRACK 8/10 MISMATCH:**
- [x] Issue identified: Track 8 sends receive responses from track 10
- [x] Created diagnostic script to identify pattern
- [ ] Waiting for: User to run diagnostic and provide results
- [ ] Root cause: Unknown (needs diagnostic data)

## Implementation Status
- Phase: BUG INVESTIGATION
- Status: DIAGNOSTIC TOOL CREATED
- Branch: feature/track-8-10-mismatch

## Issue Details
User reports that when sending volume commands to track 8, Ableton responds with track 10's data:
```
SEND: /live/track/set/volume FLOAT(8) FLOAT(0.6648851)
RECEIVE: /live/track/get/volume FLOAT(10) FLOAT(0.6721716)
```

This is a 2-track offset which suggests:
1. Hidden/folded tracks in Ableton
2. Group track counting issues
3. AbletonOSC indexing bug
4. Master track being counted

## Diagnostic Script Created
Created `scripts/diagnostics/track_mismatch_test.lua` v1.0.0 that:
- Lists all tracks with names and indices
- Tests volume commands on each track
- Reports which track actually responds
- Identifies any systematic offset pattern

## Next Steps
1. User runs diagnostic script
2. Analyze results to identify pattern
3. Implement fix based on findings
4. Test fix with user's setup
