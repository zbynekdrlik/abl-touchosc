# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fixed all fader script issues (v2.3.3)
- [x] Fader working correctly with Ableton
- [ ] Currently: Ready to add meter control to band_CG #
- [ ] Waiting for: User to add meter and continue testing
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: 3 - Script Functionality Testing
- Step: Testing individual controls on band_CG # group
- Status: TESTING
- Date: 2025-06-28

## Current Testing Progress
### band_CG # Group Setup
- ✅ Group created with status indicator
- ✅ Group script v1.7.0 attached
- ✅ OSC receive pattern set
- ✅ Successfully mapped to Track 39
- ✅ Status indicator GREEN
- ✅ Controls enabled (5 controls)

### Fader Control
- ✅ Fader added to group
- ✅ OSC receive pattern set (/live/track/get/volume)
- ✅ Fixed: Connection routing (v2.2.0)
- ✅ Fixed: OSC receive tag format (v2.3.1)
- ✅ Fixed: OSC send missing volume parameter (v2.3.2)
- ✅ Fixed: Volume logs moved to debug mode (v2.3.3)
- ✅ FULLY WORKING with all sophisticated features

### Remaining Controls to Test
- ⏳ Meter - Ready to add
- ⏳ Mute button - Not tested
- ⏳ Pan control - Not tested

## Critical Issues Fixed in This Thread

### 1. Script Isolation Issue
**Problem**: Fader tried to call `documentScript.getConnectionForInstance()`
**Solution**: Scripts are completely isolated in TouchOSC - each script must read config directly
**Fixed in**: v2.2.0

### 2. Tag Format Change
**Problem**: Group script now uses "instance:track" format (e.g., "band:39") but fader expected just "39"
**Solution**: Extract track number from new format in onReceiveOSC
**Fixed in**: v2.3.1

### 3. OSC Send Parameter Issue
**Problem**: Fader only sent track number without volume value
**Solution**: Fixed sendOSCRouted to properly send both parameters
**Fixed in**: v2.3.2

### 4. Logger Verbosity
**Problem**: Volume changes spamming the logger
**Solution**: Moved volume change logs to debug mode only
**Fixed in**: v2.3.3

## Script Versions
- **document_script.lua**: v2.5.9 ✅ (centralized logging working)
- **group_init.lua**: v1.7.0 ✅ (tested and working)
- **global_refresh_button.lua**: v1.4.0 ✅ (tested and working)
- **fader_script.lua**: v2.3.3 ✅ (FULLY TESTED AND WORKING)
- **meter_script.lua**: v2.1.0 ❌ (not tested)
- **mute_button.lua**: v1.1.0 ❌ (not tested)
- **pan_control.lua**: v1.1.0 ❌ (not tested)

## Key Learnings

### TouchOSC Script Isolation
1. Scripts CANNOT share variables or functions
2. Each script must be completely self-contained
3. Communication only via:
   - `notify()` - for messages between scripts
   - Parent/child properties
   - Reading shared controls (like configuration text)

### Configuration Pattern
Scripts that need connection info must:
1. Find the configuration control: `root:findByName("configuration", true)`
2. Parse the text directly
3. Cannot rely on helper functions from other scripts

### OSC Patterns
- Send format: `/path/to/command track_number value connection_table`
- Receive must handle exact format expected by Ableton
- Connection routing requires explicit connection table

## Next Steps
1. Add meter control to band_CG #
2. Test meter functionality
3. Add and test mute button
4. Add and test pan control
5. Create master_Hand1 # group
6. Test multi-instance routing

## Configuration Reminder
Current real-world configuration:
```
connection_band: 2
connection_master: 3
```

## Testing Checklist for band_CG #
- [x] Group initializes correctly
- [x] Refresh maps track successfully
- [x] Fader controls volume
- [ ] Meter shows levels
- [ ] Mute button works
- [ ] Pan control works
- [x] All logs use centralized logging
- [x] No cross-talk with other connections

## Summary
Major progress made - fixed all critical fader issues. The sophisticated fader with all its features (movement smoothing, 0.1dB response, double-tap to 0dB, etc.) is now fully working with the multi-connection routing system. Ready to continue testing with remaining controls.
