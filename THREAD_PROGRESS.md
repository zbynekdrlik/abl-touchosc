## Current Task: Fix Group Interactivity Bug
**Started**: 2025-07-05  
**Branch**: feature/fix-group-interactivity
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
**PR**: #16 - Created, waiting for testing

### Problem Description:
When a group is enabled/mapped, the meter control was incorrectly becoming interactive along with the fader, mute, and pan controls. Meter and labels should always remain non-interactive.

### Solution Implemented:
Modified `setGroupEnabled` function in `group_init.lua` to:
1. Split controls into two categories:
   - Interactive controls: fader, mute, pan (change with group state)
   - Non-interactive controls: meter, track_label, db (always non-interactive)
2. Added explicit logic to keep non-interactive controls non-interactive
3. Added debug logging to track interactivity changes

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ **group_init.lua v1.16.3**:
   - Fixed `setGroupEnabled` function
   - Split control lists into interactive and non-interactive
   - Added logging for interactivity changes
   - **DEBUG = 0** (production ready)

### Testing Required:
- [ ] Load TouchOSC with updated script
- [ ] Verify meters and labels are non-interactive initially
- [ ] Map a group to a track in Ableton
- [ ] Verify fader, mute, pan become interactive
- [ ] Verify meter and labels remain non-interactive
- [ ] Test with DEBUG=1 to see logging

## Previous Tasks Completed:
1. **Refresh Track Renumbering Fix** - PR #15 ready to merge (from previous thread)
2. **Notify Usage Analysis** - Merged PR #12
3. **Remove Centralized Logging** - Merged PR #11
4. **Dead Code Removal** - Completed in PR #12

## Next Steps:
1. User tests the interactivity fix
2. If successful, merge PR #16
3. Check if PR #15 should still be merged
