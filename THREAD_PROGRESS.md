# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Group init script updated with auto-detection (v1.14.0)
- [ ] Currently working on: TESTING group auto-detection
- [ ] Waiting for: Test results from group script
- [ ] Blocked by: Need to verify auto-detection works before updating child scripts

## Implementation Status
- Phase: TESTING GROUP SCRIPT
- Step: Testing auto-detection in group_init.lua
- Status: Need test results before proceeding

## Testing Instructions for Group Script

### Setup Required:
1. Install forked AbletonOSC with return track support
2. Create an Ableton project with:
   - Regular tracks (e.g., "Drums", "Bass", "Lead")
   - Return tracks (e.g., "Reverb", "Delay")
3. Update TouchOSC template with new group_init.lua v1.14.0

### Test Cases:

#### Test 1: Regular Track Detection
1. Create group named `band_Drums` (or any regular track name)
2. Press refresh button
3. **Expected logs:**
   ```
   Refreshing track mapping with auto-detection
   Mapped to Regular Track [number]
   ```
4. **Expected behavior:**
   - Status indicator turns green
   - Controls enabled
   - Tag shows: "band:[number]:track"

#### Test 2: Return Track Detection  
1. Create group named `band_Reverb` (or any return track name)
2. Press refresh button
3. **Expected logs:**
   ```
   Refreshing track mapping with auto-detection
   Mapped to Return Track [number]
   ```
4. **Expected behavior:**
   - Status indicator turns green
   - Controls enabled
   - Tag shows: "band:[number]:return"

#### Test 3: Non-Existent Track
1. Create group named `band_NonExistent`
2. Press refresh button
3. **Expected logs:**
   ```
   ERROR: Track not found: 'NonExistent' (checked both regular and return tracks)
   ```
4. **Expected behavior:**
   - Status indicator stays red
   - Controls remain disabled

#### Test 4: Multiple Instances
1. Create groups for both regular and return tracks
2. Use different connections (band/master)
3. Verify each maps to correct track type

### What to Check:
1. **OSC Messages** - Check TouchOSC console for:
   - `/live/song/get/track_names` sent
   - `/live/song/get/return_track_names` sent
   - Correct listeners started (`/live/track/` vs `/live/return/`)

2. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Status indicators (red = unmapped, green = mapped)
   - Track labels show correct names
   - Controls enable/disable properly

3. **Potential Issues to Watch**:
   - Timing issues between queries
   - Name matching problems
   - Connection routing errors

### Debug Tips:
- Enable logging in TouchOSC console
- Check for any script errors
- Monitor OSC traffic to verify correct paths

## Implementation Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed:
1. **Updated group_init.lua (v1.14.0)**:
   - Added trackType variable
   - Queries both track lists
   - Auto-detection logic
   - Dynamic OSC paths
   - getTrackType() function

### üîÑ Current Testing Focus:
- Verify auto-detection works correctly
- Check both regular and return tracks
- Ensure proper OSC routing
- Test error cases

### ‚ùå Pending (DO NOT START YET):
- Update child scripts
- Remove old return implementation
- Update documentation

## Code to Monitor

Key sections in group_init.lua to watch:

```lua
-- Line ~311: Regular track detection
if path == '/live/song/get/track_names' then
    -- Should find regular tracks here

-- Line ~360: Return track detection  
if path == '/live/song/get/return_track_names' then
    -- Should find return tracks here

-- Line ~275: OSC listener setup
-- Should use correct prefix based on trackType
local oscPrefix = trackType == "return" and "/live/return/" or "/live/track/"
```

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-03 11:30
- Action: Requested to test group script first
- Result: Ready for testing
- Next Required: Test results and any needed fixes

## Next Steps
1. **Test the group script thoroughly**
2. **Fix any issues found**
3. **Save state once working**
4. **Then update child scripts**

## Notes for Testing
- The script should be completely transparent
- No special configuration needed
- Just name groups normally
- Auto-detection should "just work"

## Expected Test Results
Please provide:
1. Log output from each test case
2. Any error messages
3. Observed behavior vs expected
4. Any timing or sync issues
5. OSC message flow

Once testing confirms the auto-detection works properly, we'll save this state and proceed with updating the child scripts.
