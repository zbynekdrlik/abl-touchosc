# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Double-click mute feature - TESTING IN PROGRESS
- [x] Bug found: Pattern matching fails with special characters (hyphens)
- [x] Bug fixed: v2.4.1 adds pattern escaping
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test the fix
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: BUG FIX DEPLOYED
- Step: Testing pattern matching fix
- Status: AWAITING TEST RESULTS
- Branch: feature/double-click-mute
- PR: #24 (open) - https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/abl-touchosc/pull/24

## Bug Found and Fixed
**Issue**: Configuration `double_click_mute_master: 'master_A-ReproM'` was not working

**Root Cause**: The hyphen in "A-ReproM" is a special character in Lua patterns (means "zero or more occurrences"). The pattern matching was failing.

**Fix Applied (v2.4.1)**:
- Added `escapePattern()` function to escape special characters
- Pattern now correctly matches group names with hyphens, dots, brackets, etc.
- Only 4 lines added to fix

## Configuration Format (FINAL)
```yaml
# IMPORTANT: Each group needs its own line!
# Only instance-specific configuration is supported

# Instance-specific (one group per line)
double_click_mute_master: 'master_A-ReproM'  # This now works!
double_click_mute_band: 'Band Tracks'
double_click_mute_band: 'Lead Vocals'
```

## Recent Changes (This Session)
1. User tested with `double_click_mute_master: 'master_A-ReproM'`
2. Found pattern matching bug - hyphen not escaped
3. Fixed in v2.4.1 by adding pattern escaping
4. Committed fix to branch

## What User Needs to Do Next
1. **Pull the latest changes**: `git pull`
2. **Update TouchOSC template** with fixed script (v2.4.1)
3. **Test again** with same configuration
4. Should now see "Double-click required: true" in logs

## Testing Checklist for User
- [ ] Pattern matching works with special characters (hyphens, dots, etc.)
- [ ] Single-click works on non-configured tracks
- [ ] Double-click required on configured tracks
- [ ] 500ms timing feels natural
- [ ] Configuration parsing works correctly
- [ ] No regression on existing functionality
- [ ] Multiple instances work independently

## Technical Details
- Version: v2.4.1 (was v2.4.0)
- Fix: Added `escapePattern()` function
- Escapes: - ^ $ ( ) % . [ ] * + ?
- Pattern matching now handles all special characters
- Total lines added: 19 (15 original + 4 for fix)

## Next Thread Should:
1. Verify user test results with v2.4.1
2. If pattern matching works:
   - Complete remaining tests
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Merge PR if all tests pass
3. If still issues:
   - Debug further
   - Check exact configuration format
   - Verify group name matches exactly
