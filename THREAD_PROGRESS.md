- All controls implemented and tested

## Solution Components

### 1. AbletonOSC Fork
- Repository: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC
- Branch: feature/return-tracks-support
- PR: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC/pull/2
- **STATUS: WORKING IN PRODUCTION**

### 2. TouchOSC Scripts Created
- `scripts/return/group_init.lua` - Return track group management
- `scripts/return/fader_script.lua` - Volume control
- `scripts/return/mute_button.lua` - Mute control
- `scripts/return/pan_control.lua` - Pan control
- `scripts/return/README.md` - Documentation

### 3. Documentation
- `templates/return_tracks_example.md` - Usage examples
- `docs/return-track-implementation.md` - Technical documentation
- Updated README with return track support
- Updated CHANGELOG with v1.2.0 release

### 4. OSC Commands Implemented
**Query Messages:**
- `/live/song/get/num_return_tracks` ✅
- `/live/song/get/return_track_names` ✅
- `/live/song/get/return_track_data` ✅

**Control Messages** (`/live/return/`):
- Volume, panning, mute, solo ✅
- Send controls ✅
- Device queries ✅
- Clip operations ✅
- Output routing ✅

## Summary

The return track support has been successfully implemented through:

1. **Forking AbletonOSC** and adding the missing return track exposure
2. **Creating TouchOSC scripts** that mirror regular track functionality
3. **Testing and verification** showing everything works as expected
4. **Complete documentation** for users to implement

The solution maintains 100% backward compatibility while adding powerful new functionality. Users simply need to install the forked AbletonOSC to enable return track control.

## PR Status

**PR #8 is ready to merge** with:
- ✅ Complete implementation
- ✅ Tested and verified
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Clear upgrade path for users

## Original Investigation
- Problem: AbletonOSC didn't expose return tracks
- Root cause: Only counted `song.tracks`, ignored `song.return_tracks`
- Solution: Forked and added comprehensive return track support
- Result: WORKING - Return tracks fully accessible and controllable
