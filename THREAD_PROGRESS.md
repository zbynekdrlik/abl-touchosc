## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Fix refresh all button track renumbering issue
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing of the CRITICAL fix in v2.8.4
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Current Task: Fix Refresh Track Renumbering
**Started**: 2025-07-05
**Branch**: feature/fix-refresh-track-renumbering  
**Status**: CRITICAL_FIX_APPLIED
**PR**: #15 - Updated with critical fix

### Problem Found:
1. When inserting a new track at the beginning in Ableton, all tracks get renumbered but the "Refresh All" button doesn't properly reassign groups to the correct track numbers.
2. **CRITICAL BUG**: After the first mapping, subsequent refresh attempts would find 0 groups because it was looking for the "trackGroup" tag which changes after mapping.

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Updated group_init.lua v1.16.1:
   - Fixed clear_mapping to reset tag to "trackGroup" 
   - Added notification to children about mapping_cleared
   - Ensures no stale track references remain

2. ✅ Updated fader_script.lua v2.5.3:
   - Added handling for mapping_cleared notification
   - Cancels any ongoing animations when mapping is cleared
   - Ensures fader always reads fresh track info from parent tag

3. ✅ Updated document_script.lua v2.8.3:
   - Added 100ms delay between clear and refresh operations
   - Ensures all scripts have time to process the clear before new mappings
   - Improved status feedback during refresh sequence

4. ✅ **CRITICAL FIX** - document_script.lua v2.8.4:
   - Fixed group finding mechanism to use name pattern instead of tag
   - Now finds groups by names starting with "band_" or "master_"
   - Works correctly for both initial and subsequent refreshes
   - Solves the "Cleared 0 groups" bug

### Testing Instructions:
1. Open Ableton with multiple tracks (e.g., 4-8 tracks)
2. Map tracks in TouchOSC and verify faders control correct tracks
3. Press "Refresh All" to ensure it finds groups (should say "Cleared 2 groups", NOT 0)
4. Insert a new track at the beginning in Ableton
5. Press "Refresh All" button in TouchOSC again
6. Verify that:
   - Console shows "Cleared 2 groups" (or appropriate number, NOT 0)
   - Status shows "Clearing..." then "Waiting..." then "Refreshing..." then "Ready"
   - All faders now control the correct renumbered tracks
   - No faders control the wrong track

### Changes Made:
- **group_init.lua**: Reset tag on clear_mapping, notify children
- **fader_script.lua**: Handle mapping_cleared notification
- **document_script.lua v2.8.3**: Add delay between clear and refresh phases
- **document_script.lua v2.8.4**: CRITICAL - Fix group finding to use name pattern

## Previous Task: Notify Usage Analysis & Cleanup (COMPLETE)
**Completed**: 2025-07-04
**Branch**: feature/notify-usage-analysis (merged)
**PR**: #12 - Merged

### Summary:
- Analyzed all scripts for notify() usage
- Confirmed notify is only used for inter-script communication
- No high-frequency usage found
- Removed dead configuration_updated handler

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Bug Fixes & Improvements
- Step: Track renumbering refresh fix with critical bug fix
- Status: CODE_COMPLETE

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| group_init.lua v1.16.1 | ✅ | Clear mapping improved |
| fader_script.lua v2.5.3 | ✅ | Handles mapping_cleared |
| document_script.lua v2.8.3 | ✅ | Added refresh delay |
| document_script.lua v2.8.4 | ✅ | CRITICAL: Fixed group finding |
| Integration Testing | ⏳ | Ready for user testing |

## Next Steps:
1. User tests the fix with track renumbering scenario
2. User must verify console shows groups being found (not 0)
3. Verify all faders control correct tracks after refresh
4. Merge PR if successful
5. Update main branch
