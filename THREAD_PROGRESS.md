# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**✅ ALL FIXES TESTED AND WORKING - READY TO MERGE:**
- [x] Issue identified: Feedback loop when moving faders in Ableton
- [x] Root cause: TouchOSC sending OSC back when receiving updates from Ableton
- [x] Fix implemented: Added updating_from_osc flag in fader_script.lua v2.5.4
- [x] Testing completed: Feedback loop fix confirmed working by user

## Implementation Status
- Phase: ALL FIXES COMPLETED AND TESTED
- Status: READY TO MERGE
- Branch: feature/track-8-10-mismatch
- AbletonOSC PR: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC/pull/3

## Latest Fix: Feedback Loop Prevention (v2.5.4) ✅
**Issue:** When moving fader in Ableton:
1. Ableton sends OSC to TouchOSC to update fader position
2. TouchOSC receives and updates its fader (self.values.x)
3. This triggers onValueChanged() which sends OSC back to Ableton
4. Creates feedback loop making Ableton fader jumpy/laggy

**Solution:** Added `updating_from_osc` flag to prevent sending OSC when updating from received OSC:
- Set flag before updating self.values.x in onReceiveOSC()
- Check flag in onValueChanged() and skip sending if set
- Also set flag in update() function during sync operations

**Testing Result:** ✅ User confirmed fix is working - no more feedback loop!

## AbletonOSC Fixes Created
1. **Fixed String/Bytes Error** (osc_server.py)
   - Fixed "write() argument must be str, not bytes" error
   - Added proper decoding when writing debug data

2. **Fixed Listener Cross-Wiring** (track.py & handler.py)
   - Added thread-safe listener registration with locks
   - Fixed track index validation to prevent out-of-bounds
   - Improved error handling in callbacks  
   - Ensured correct track indices are always sent

3. **Fixed Observer Errors**
   - Added clear_api method to safely remove all listeners
   - Improved listener cleanup on shutdown

## Summary of All Fixes
### TouchOSC Repository (this PR):
- **fader_script.lua v2.5.4**: Fixed feedback loop with updating_from_osc flag
- **track_mismatch_test.lua v1.1.0**: Diagnostic tool for testing

### AbletonOSC Repository (separate PR):
- **osc_server.py**: Fixed string/bytes error
- **handler.py**: Added thread-safe listener registration
- **track.py**: Fixed track index validation and cleanup

## Testing Completed
- [x] Feedback loop fix tested - faders move smoothly from Ableton
- [x] Bidirectional sync working without jumps
- [x] No more laggy/jumpy behavior

## Ready for Merge
All issues have been identified, fixed, and tested successfully. Both TouchOSC and AbletonOSC fixes are working as expected.
