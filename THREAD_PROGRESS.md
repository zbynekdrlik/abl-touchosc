# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTED BUT NOT TESTED - UNKNOWN WORKING STATE**
- [x] Currently working on: Phase 1 optimizations implemented
- [ ] Waiting for: Testing to verify no regressions
- [ ] Blocked by: Need to verify scripts actually work

## Current Status (2025-07-04 16:25 UTC)

### ⚠️ PHASE 1 OPTIMIZATIONS IMPLEMENTED (NOT TESTED)

**WARNING**: All optimizations are implemented but NONE have been tested. Working state is UNKNOWN.

#### What was implemented:
1. **Pan Control Optimization (v1.5.0)** ❓
   - Scheduled update() at 10Hz
   - Early exit when unchanged
   - NOT TESTED - may have regressions

2. **Fader Script (v2.7.0)** ❓
   - Already done in previous thread
   - But not tested in this context

3. **Debug Guards Added** ❓
   - All 6 scripts + document script
   - Added `if DEBUG ~= 1 then return end`
   - Set DEBUG = 0
   - NOT TESTED - may break functionality

### CRITICAL UNKNOWNS:
1. **Metering/Status Indicator** ❓
   - Working state completely unknown
   - Never analyzed or tested
   
2. **notify() Usage** ❓
   - Still used throughout scripts
   - Need to analyze if this is correct approach
   - May be causing performance issues

3. **Regression Risk** ⚠️
   - No testing done on ANY changes
   - Could have broken core functionality
   - Need comprehensive testing

### VERSION TRACKING - UNTESTED
| Script | Version | Status | Risk |
|--------|---------|--------|------|
| fader_script | v2.7.0 | Implemented | UNTESTED |
| pan_control | v1.5.0 | Implemented | UNTESTED |
| meter_script | v2.5.8 | Implemented | UNTESTED |
| db_label | v1.3.3 | Implemented | UNTESTED |
| mute_button | v2.0.4 | Implemented | UNTESTED |
| db_meter_label | v2.6.2 | Implemented | UNTESTED |
| group_init | v1.16.0 | Implemented | UNTESTED |
| document_script | v2.7.5 | Implemented | UNTESTED |

### NEXT THREAD MUST:
1. **Test all scripts thoroughly**
2. **Verify no regressions**
3. **Analyze notify() usage pattern**
4. **Check metering/status indicator**
5. **Only then can we say Phase 1 is complete**

### TESTING CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Scripts load without errors
- [ ] Version numbers appear in logs
- [ ] Faders work correctly
- [ ] Pan controls work correctly
- [ ] Meters display properly
- [ ] Labels show correct values
- [ ] Mute buttons function
- [ ] Group initialization works
- [ ] No performance regressions
- [ ] notify() not causing issues

## State Saved: 2025-07-04 16:25 UTC
**Status**: Phase 1 IMPLEMENTED but NOT TESTED - working state UNKNOWN
**Next Action**: Comprehensive testing before claiming completion
**Critical**: Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 until all tests pass
