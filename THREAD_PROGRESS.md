# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: IDENTIFIED ROOT CAUSE - Architectural mistake with notify()
- [x] Waiting for: Deep analysis of OSC handling in all scripts - COMPLETED
- [x] Blocked by: Need to revert to direct OSC handling everywhere - FIXES IMPLEMENTED

## Current Status (2025-07-04 20:08 UTC)

### ✅ CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

**SCRIPTS FIXED:**
1. **meter_script.lua (v2.6.2)** 
   - ✅ FIXED: Removed `parentGroup:notify("value_changed", "meter")`
   - ✅ Now only receives OSC directly without notification chains
   
2. **group_init.lua (v1.17.0)**
   - ✅ FIXED: Removed value_changed forwarding section
   - ✅ Touch notifications kept (lightweight and needed)
   
3. **db_meter_label.lua (v2.7.0)**
   - ✅ Already fixed - no changes needed
   
4. **db_label.lua (v1.3.4)**
   - ✅ Already correct - no changes needed

### RESULTS:
- **Before**: Meter → notifies parent → parent forwards to all children → LAG
- **After**: Each control receives OSC directly → NO LAG

### NEXT STEPS FOR USER:
1. **TEST THE FIXES**
   - Upload the updated scripts to TouchOSC
   - Test meter responsiveness
   - Verify no lag in updates
   - Check all controls still work

2. **PROVIDE LOGS**
   - Show meter updates are real-time
   - Confirm no notification chains in logs
   - Verify version numbers (2.6.2 and 1.17.0)

3. **IF STILL LAGGY**
   - Check if fader touch notifications need removal
   - Look for any other hidden notification chains
   - Verify OSC receive patterns are set correctly in UI

### ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE RESTORED:
**"Every control that needs data should receive it directly via OSC, NOT through notify chains!"**
