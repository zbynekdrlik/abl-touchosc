# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Clean minimal fix branch created from main
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test the minimal fix on Android tablet
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Android tablet fix - MINIMAL VERSION
- Step: Applied only the race condition fix to group_init.lua
- Status: IMPLEMENTED - NEEDS TESTING

## The Fix
Created a clean branch with ONLY the essential fix:
- `group_init.lua` v1.17.1 - Added processedRegularTracks and processedReturnTracks flags
- This prevents "Track not found" errors when track names arrive at different times
- No delays, no timing changes, just the race condition fix

## Testing Required
1. Test on Android tablet with return tracks visible
2. Verify tracks map correctly (green indicators)
3. Confirm no "not found" errors in logs
4. Test refresh button works reliably

## Next Steps After Testing
If this minimal fix works:
1. Merge PR #29 (this minimal fix)
2. Close PR #28 (contains unnecessary changes)
3. Merge PR #24 (double-click mute feature)
4. Create v1.5.0 release

If issues persist:
- Use the backup branch (fix/android-tablet-refresh-timing) for deeper analysis
- The backup branch has extensive logging enabled
