# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ ABLETONOSC BUG IDENTIFIED - CROSS-WIRED LISTENERS:**
- [x] Issue identified: Multiple tracks receiving same listener events
- [x] Pattern found: Track 5 broadcasts to tracks 5,6,7; Track 8 responds as track 10
- [x] Root cause: AbletonOSC listener system bug (not TouchOSC issue)
- [ ] Next step: Investigate AbletonOSC fork to fix the bug at source

## Implementation Status
- Phase: BUG ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
- Status: PIVOTING TO ABLETONOSC FORK INVESTIGATION
- Branch: feature/track-8-10-mismatch

## Issue Analysis
User logs show clear evidence of AbletonOSC listener cross-wiring:

**Track 5 broadcasting to multiple tracks:**
```
SEND: /live/track/set/volume FLOAT(5) FLOAT(0.7755736)
RECEIVE: /live/track/get/volume FLOAT(5) FLOAT(0.7755736)
RECEIVE: /live/track/get/volume FLOAT(6) FLOAT(0.7755736)
RECEIVE: /live/track/get/volume FLOAT(7) FLOAT(0.7755736)
```

**Track 8 receiving as track 10:**
```
SEND: /live/track/set/volume FLOAT(8) FLOAT(0.7574361)
RECEIVE: /live/track/get/volume FLOAT(10) FLOAT(0.7574361)
```

## Key Findings
1. This is NOT a TouchOSC issue
2. The problem is in AbletonOSC's listener registration/routing
3. No hidden tracks, no group tracks - pure AbletonOSC bug
4. Pattern suggests listeners are being registered to wrong track indices

## Next Steps
1. Access user's AbletonOSC fork
2. Investigate listener registration in track.py
3. Check how start_listen/stop_listen manages track indices
4. Fix the cross-wiring bug in AbletonOSC
5. Test fix with user's Ableton setup
