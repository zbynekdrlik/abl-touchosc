# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ WORKING ON PAN CONTROL RESTORATION:**
- [x] Currently working on: Restored missing pan control features (color change & double-tap)
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test implementation in TouchOSC
- [ ] Branch: feature/restore-pan-features
- [ ] PR #18 created and ready for testing

## Current Task: Restore Missing Pan Control Features
**Started**: 2025-07-05  
**Branch**: feature/restore-pan-features
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
**PR**: #18 - Implementation complete, awaiting testing

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ **pan_control.lua v1.5.1 → v1.5.2**:
   - Restored color change functionality
   - Added COLOR_CENTERED and COLOR_OFF_CENTER constants
   - Restored update() function for visual feedback
   - Restored double-tap detection logic
   - Added DOUBLE_TAP_DELAY constant (300ms)
   - Integrated double-tap handling in onValueChanged()
   - Set initial color in init()
   - **DEBUG = 0** (production ready)

### Features Restored:
1. **Color Change**: 
   - Gray (#646464) when pan is centered
   - Cyan (#34C1DC) when pan is off-center
   - Uses update() function to continuously check position
   - 0.01 threshold to avoid flickering

2. **Double-tap to Center**:
   - 300ms time window for double-tap detection
   - Centers pan to 0.5 (TouchOSC) / 0 (Ableton)
   - Sends OSC message to update Ableton
   - Logs double-tap detection (when DEBUG=1)

### Implementation Analysis:
- Compared with old v1.4.1 code provided by user
- Identified exactly 2 missing features (color change & double-tap)
- Current version has additional improvements:
  - Better state management (isTouching flag)
  - Connection routing support
  - Notify handlers for track changes
  - Touch state tracking to prevent value jumps
- Other scripts checked - no missing features found

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Verify pan color is gray when centered
- [ ] Verify pan color is cyan when off-center
- [ ] Test double-tap centers the pan to 0.5
- [ ] Confirm OSC message sent to Ableton on double-tap
- [ ] Test with regular tracks
- [ ] Test with return tracks
- [ ] Verify multi-connection support works
- [ ] Check no performance issues with update() function
- [ ] Confirm version 1.5.2 loads in logs

## Previous PRs Pending:
1. **PR #16** - Group Interactivity Fix (ready to merge)
   - Simplified interactivity handling
   - Only sets fader, mute, pan as interactive
   - Meters/labels remain non-interactive
   
2. **PR #15** - Refresh Track Renumbering Fix (ready to merge)
   - Registration system for track groups
   - Fixes refresh when tracks renumbered in Ableton

## Next Steps:
1. User tests restored pan features in TouchOSC
2. If issues found, fix and update version
3. Update CHANGELOG.md after testing success
4. Merge PR #18 after approval
5. Consider merging pending PRs #15 and #16

## Session Notes:
- User reported pan control lost color change and double-tap functionality
- Old working version (v1.4.1) was provided as reference
- Implementation kept simple and performant
- All project rules followed (local logging, Color constructor, etc.)
- No other scripts were missing features
