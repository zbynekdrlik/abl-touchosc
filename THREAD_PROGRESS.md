- [ ] Waiting for: User to test the simplified fix
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Current Task: Fix Group Interactivity Bug
**Started**: 2025-07-05  
**Branch**: feature/fix-group-interactivity
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
**PR**: #16 - Updated with simplified solution

### Problem Description:
When a group is enabled/mapped, the meter control was incorrectly becoming interactive along with the fader, mute, and pan controls. Meter and labels should always remain non-interactive.

### Solution Implemented (v1.16.4):
Simplified approach - only handle controls that need to change:
1. Removed all code that sets controls to non-interactive
2. Only set interactivity for: fader, mute, pan
3. Let TouchOSC editor handle non-interactive state for meters/labels
4. Much cleaner, simpler code

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ **group_init.lua v1.16.4**:
   - Simplified `setGroupEnabled` function
   - Only handles fader, mute, pan interactivity
   - Removed unnecessary non-interactive code
   - **DEBUG = 0** (production ready)

### Testing Required:
- [ ] Ensure meters/labels are non-interactive in TouchOSC editor
- [ ] Load TouchOSC with updated script
- [ ] Map a group to a track in Ableton
- [ ] Verify fader, mute, pan become interactive
- [ ] Verify meter and labels remain non-interactive

## Previous Tasks Completed:
1. **Refresh Track Renumbering Fix** - PR #15 ready to merge (from previous thread)
2. **Notify Usage Analysis** - Merged PR #12
3. **Remove Centralized Logging** - Merged PR #11
4. **Dead Code Removal** - Completed in PR #12

## Next Steps:
1. User tests the simplified interactivity fix
2. If successful, merge PR #16
3. Check if PR #15 should still be merged
