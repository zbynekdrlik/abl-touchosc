# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Confirmed: AbletonOSC does NOT expose return tracks
- [x] Root cause found in AbletonOSC source code
- [ ] **BLOCKED**: Cannot proceed without modifying AbletonOSC
- [ ] Need to decide on workaround or fork strategy

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY - ABLETONOSC LIMITATION CONFIRMED
**Investigation Complete:**
- AbletonOSC only counts regular tracks in `get_num_tracks`
- No implementation of `song.return_tracks` access
- Return tracks exist in Live API but not in AbletonOSC
- Created/deleted return tracks are inaccessible after creation

## Implementation Status
- Phase: 1 - Core Implementation
- Step: **CANNOT PROCEED** - External dependency issue
- Status: Need to fork AbletonOSC or find alternative

## Root Cause Analysis
From AbletonOSC source (`song.py` line 138):
```python
self.osc_server.add_handler("/live/song/get/num_tracks", 
    lambda _: (len(self.song.tracks),))
```
This only returns regular tracks, not `self.song.return_tracks`.

## Options Moving Forward
1. **Fork AbletonOSC** - Add return track support
2. **File bug report** - Wait for official fix
3. **Alternative OSC solution** - Find different implementation
4. **Workaround** - Use regular tracks as returns

## Documentation Created
- `docs/abletonosc-return-track-issue.md` - Complete investigation findings
- All test scripts validated the limitation
- Root cause identified in source code

## Recommendation
Cannot implement return track support in TouchOSC without first fixing AbletonOSC. This is an external dependency issue, not a TouchOSC limitation.
