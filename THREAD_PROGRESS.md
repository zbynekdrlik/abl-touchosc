# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Created test scripts for return track discovery
- [x] Connection verified working (Connection 1)
- [ ] Currently debugging: Index 9 gives "out of range" but user has Return Track A
- [ ] Waiting for: User to run track_discovery_debug.lua
- [ ] Next: Find why AbletonOSC doesn't see return tracks beyond index 8

## Implementation Status
- Phase: 1 - Core Implementation
- Step: Debugging AbletonOSC track indexing
- Status: INVESTIGATING - Return tracks not accessible at expected indices

## NEW DISCOVERY - CRITICAL ISSUE
User has:
- 9 regular tracks (indices 0-8)
- Return Track A exists in Ableton
- BUT: Index 9 gives "Index out of range" error
- This suggests AbletonOSC might not be exposing return tracks as expected

## Test Scripts Created
1. **return_track_test_fader.lua v1.0.1**
   - Auto-discovers Return Track A
   - Extensive logging
   - ✅ Connection works, but needs correct index

2. **connection_test.lua v1.0.0** / **v2.0.0**
   - Tests connections 1-10 sequentially
   - ✅ Confirmed Connection 1 works

3. **simple_return_test.lua v1.0.0**
   - Direct control without discovery
   - Assumes Return A at index 6
   - Needs correct index to work

4. **track_discovery_debug.lua v1.0.0** (NEW)
   - Queries total track count
   - Lists all track names
   - Will reveal actual track structure

## User Test Results
```
Connection 1: ✅ WORKING
Track indices 0-8: Control regular tracks 1-9
Track index 9: ❌ "Index out of range" error
Return Track A: Exists but index unknown
```

## Troubleshooting Progress
1. ✅ OSC Connection verified working
2. ✅ AbletonOSC is running and responding
3. ❌ Return tracks not at expected indices
4. ⏳ Need to run track_discovery_debug.lua

## Feature: Add Send/Return Track Control
Enable control of Ableton's send/return tracks in addition to regular audio/MIDI tracks.

### Phase 0 Complete ✅
- [x] 0.1 Research & Documentation
- [x] 0.2 Test Script Development
- [x] 0.3 Source Code Analysis - CONFIRMED: Extended indexing approach

### Phase 1 In Progress - BLOCKED
- [x] Created test scripts
- [x] Connection verified
- [ ] **ISSUE**: Return tracks not accessible at expected indices
- [ ] Investigating AbletonOSC behavior

## Possible Explanations
1. AbletonOSC might only report regular tracks in `/live/song/get/num_tracks`
2. Return tracks might need different API calls
3. There might be a configuration setting in AbletonOSC
4. Bug in AbletonOSC with return track indexing

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Created | Tested | Issue | Resolution |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------|------------|
| Connection test | ✅ | ✅ | - | Connection 1 works |
| Direct fader test | ✅ | ✅ | Index 9 out of range | Need correct index |
| track_discovery_debug | ✅ | ⏳ | - | Waiting to run |

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **User needs to run track_discovery_debug.lua**
   - Will show total track count from AbletonOSC
   - Will list all accessible track names
   - Will reveal the actual structure

2. **Based on results, we'll either:**
   - Find the correct index for return tracks
   - Discover a different API for return tracks
   - Identify a limitation in AbletonOSC

## Key Discovery
- Connection works ✅
- Regular tracks work ✅
- Return tracks exist but aren't where expected ❌

## Thread Handoff Notes
- Connection issue resolved
- New issue: Return tracks not at expected indices
- track_discovery_debug.lua created to investigate
- Waiting for debug results to determine next steps
