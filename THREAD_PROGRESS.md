# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Fixed meter lag and fader overshoot issues
- [ ] Waiting for: User to TEST fixes (v2.6.0 meter, v2.7.2 fader)
- [ ] Blocked by: Need test results before proceeding

## Current Status (2025-07-04 19:13 UTC)

### ⚠️ PHASE 1 BUG FIXES - PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**Fixes IMPLEMENTED (AWAITING TEST):**
1. **Meter Lag & Color Issues (v2.6.0)** ✅ FIXED
   - Problem: Color smoothing too slow (0.3), not responsive
   - Fix: Increased smoothing to 0.7, instant change for small differences
   - Also: Reduced notification threshold 5%→2%, interval 100ms→50ms
   - Also: Fixed version logging to respect DEBUG flag
   
2. **Fader Overshoot at 0dB (v2.7.2)** ✅ FIXED
   - Problem: Double-tap animation overshooting target
   - Fix: Reduced speed 0.005→0.003, added slow zone near target
   - Also: Proportional speed in slow zone, better overshoot detection
   - Also: Fixed version logging to respect DEBUG flag
   
3. **Verbose Logging** ❓ PARTIALLY FIXED
   - Fixed in: meter_script v2.6.0, fader_script v2.7.2
   - Still need to fix: Other scripts still use print() for version
   - Status: **INCOMPLETE - other scripts need fixing**

4. **Status Indicator Not Working** ❌ NOT ADDRESSED
   - User says color changes not visible
   - Meter logs show color changes happening
   - May be related to meter lag fix above

### VERSION TRACKING
| Script | Version | Status | Change Made | Tested? |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|---------|
| fader_script | v2.7.2 | FIXED | Overshoot fix + logging | ❌ NO |
| meter_script | v2.6.0 | FIXED | Lag fix + logging | ❌ NO |
| pan_control | v1.5.0 | NEEDS FIX | Verbose logging | ❌ NO |
| db_label | v1.3.3 | NEEDS FIX | Verbose logging | ❌ NO |
| mute_button | v2.0.4 | NEEDS FIX | Verbose logging | ❌ NO |
| db_meter_label | v2.6.2 | NEEDS FIX | Verbose logging | ❌ NO |
| group_init | v1.16.0 | NEEDS FIX | Verbose logging | ❌ NO |
| document_script | v2.7.5 | NEEDS FIX | Verbose logging | ❌ NO |

### USER'S LAST FEEDBACK (19:04 UTC):
- ✅ Meter working but laggy, receiving many OSC messages
- ❌ Fader overshoots 0dB then moves back
- ❌ Status indicator (meter color) not working visually
- ❌ Verbose logging even with DEBUG=0

### CHANGES MADE THIS SESSION:
1. meter_script.lua v2.6.0 - Fixed lag and color responsiveness
2. fader_script.lua v2.7.2 - Fixed double-tap overshoot

### NEXT STEPS:
1. **USER MUST TEST meter v2.6.0 and fader v2.7.2**
2. If fixes work, proceed to fix verbose logging in remaining scripts
3. If status indicator still not working, investigate further

### TESTING REQUIRED:
- [ ] Does meter update smoothly now?
- [ ] Do meter colors change visibly (green/yellow/red)?
- [ ] Does fader double-tap stop exactly at 0dB?
- [ ] Are version logs hidden when DEBUG=0?

**Status**: Fixed meter lag and fader overshoot, awaiting test
**Branch**: feature/performance-optimization  
**Next Action**: User MUST test meter v2.6.0 and fader v2.7.2
**Critical**: Still need to fix verbose logging in other scripts
