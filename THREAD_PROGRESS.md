# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**✅ FEATURE COMPLETE - READY TO MERGE:**
- [x] Feature implemented: Fader position color indicator
- [x] Testing completed: Color changes working correctly
- [x] Final version ready: v1.5.0

## Implementation Status
- Phase: NEW FEATURE - FADER POSITION COLOR INDICATOR
- Step: COMPLETE AND TESTED
- Status: READY TO MERGE
- Branch: feature/fader-position-color-indicator
- PR: #22

## Feature: Fader Position Color Indicator (v1.5.0) ✅
**Feature Request:** Change db_label color when fader is not at 0dB position

**Final Implementation:**
- Updated db_label.lua to version 1.5.0
- Uses `self.textColor` property for label text color
- White text (1, 1, 1) when exactly at 0dB
- Light green text (0.7, 1, 0.7) when fader is moved from 0dB
- No tolerance - only exact 0dB shows white (< 0.01 for floating point)
- Clean implementation with no regression risk

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Color changes are visible and working correctly
- ✅ White text appears when fader is at 0dB
- ✅ Light green text appears when fader is moved
- ✅ Double-click to 0dB shows white correctly
- ✅ No regression in existing functionality

**Files Modified:**
- scripts/track/db_label.lua (v1.3.2 → v1.5.0)

## Previous Work (Completed)
### Feedback Loop Prevention (v2.5.4) ✅
**Issue:** When moving fader in Ableton:
1. Ableton sends OSC to TouchOSC to update fader position
2. TouchOSC receives and updates its fader (self.values.x)
3. This triggers onValueChanged() which sends OSC back to Ableton
4. Creates feedback loop making Ableton fader jumpy/laggy

**Solution:** Added `updating_from_osc` flag to prevent sending OSC when updating from received OSC:
- Set flag before updating self.values.x in onReceiveOSC()
- Check flag in onValueChanged() and skip sending if set
- Also set flag in update() function during sync operations

**Testing Result:** ✅ User confirmed fix is working - no more feedback loop!

## Summary
The fader position color indicator feature is now complete and working:
- White text indicates fader is exactly at 0dB
- Light green text indicates fader is at any other position
- Visual feedback helps users quickly identify when faders are not at unity gain
- Implementation uses TouchOSC's textColor property
- No performance impact or regressions

Ready to merge PR #22!
