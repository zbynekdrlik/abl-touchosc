# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ MULTI-CONNECTION SUPPORT RESTORED - CLEAN VERSION:**
- [x] Issue identified: Meter scripts lost multi-connection support after v1.2.0
- [x] Root cause: getConnectionIndex() function and connection filtering removed
- [x] Fixed: meter_script.lua v2.5.1 (with caching for performance)
- [x] Fixed: db_meter_label.lua v2.6.2 (minimal changes only)
- [x] Fixed: db_label.lua v1.3.2 (minimal changes only)
- [x] PR #20 updated with clean versions
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing and merge approval

## Implementation Status
- Phase: CRITICAL BUG FIX - CLEAN IMPLEMENTATION
- Status: COMPLETE - Ready for testing
- Branch: feature/restore-multi-connection-meter

## What Happened
After the v1.2.0 release (which added return track support), subsequent updates to meter scripts accidentally removed the multi-connection functionality. This caused all meters to respond to ALL Ableton instances instead of filtering by their assigned connection.

## Clean Fix Applied
After user feedback about unwanted changes, created minimal versions that ONLY add:
1. The `getConnectionIndex()` function
2. Connection filtering in `onReceiveOSC()`
3. No other behavior changes

## Scripts Fixed
| Script | Old Version | Clean Version | Changes |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| meter_script.lua | 2.4.1 | 2.5.1 | Multi-connection + caching (performance critical) |
| db_meter_label.lua | 2.6.1 | 2.6.2 | Multi-connection only (no other changes) |
| db_label.lua | 1.3.1 | 1.3.2 | Multi-connection only (no other changes) |

## Scripts NOT Affected
These scripts maintained their multi-connection support:
- fader_script.lua ✅ (already has it)
- pan_control.lua ✅  
- mute_button.lua ✅
- group_init.lua ✅

## Technical Details
The regression occurred because:
1. Multi-connection support was added AFTER v1.2.0
2. When meter scripts were updated for other features, the old versions were used as base
3. The getConnectionIndex() function and connection filtering logic were not preserved

## Testing Required
Users with multiple Ableton instances should test:
1. Meters only respond to their assigned connection
2. All existing functionality remains unchanged
3. No behavioral differences except connection filtering

## Next Steps
1. User tests the fix with multiple Ableton instances
2. Verify meters are properly isolated by connection
3. Verify no other behavior has changed
4. Merge PR #20 if testing successful

## Lesson Learned
When fixing bugs:
1. Make ONLY the minimal changes needed
2. Don't add "helpful" optimizations unless requested
3. Preserve existing behavior exactly
4. Keep version increments minimal (patch level for bug fixes)
