## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ TESTING RESULTS RECEIVED - MULTIPLE CONTROLS BROKEN**
- [x] Currently working on: Received test results from user
- [ ] Waiting for: Decision on which control to fix next
- [ ] Blocked by: Fader and status indicator completely broken

## Current Status (2025-07-04 14:25 UTC)

1. **Fader** - Totally broken (main control!)
2. **Status indicator** - Not working at all
3. **Meter** - Unclear behavior

## Priority Fixes Needed

### 1. FADER (Critical - main control)
- Totally not working
- Need to check:
  - OSC receive patterns in template
  - Connection routing
  - Value processing
  - Sync delay implementation

### 2. STATUS INDICATOR
- Not working at all
- Need to identify:
  - Which script controls it
  - What it should display
  - Why it's not updating

### 3. METER
- Unclear behavior
- Need clarification:
  - What exactly is wrong?
  - Visual issues or value issues?
  - Color changes working?

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Choose priority**: Fader or Status Indicator?
2. **Get more info**: What exactly happens with fader when you move it?
3. **Clarify meter**: What behavior are you seeing?

### Testing Still Needed:
- Track switching behavior
- Double-tap features
- Performance with multiple tracks
- Connection routing verification
