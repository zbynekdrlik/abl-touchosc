# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Fixing Phase 1 bugs found in testing
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test fixes for meter, fader animation, and logging
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Current Status (2025-07-04 18:45 UTC)

### ⚠️ PHASE 1 BUG FIXES IMPLEMENTED

**Issues Fixed:**
1. **Meter Not Working (v2.5.9)** ✅
   - Fixed connection initialization timing issue
   - Deferred connection setup until track info available
   
2. **Fader Jumpy Animation (v2.7.1)** ✅
   - Increased update rate from 10Hz to 60Hz
   - Smooth double-tap animation now
   
3. **Verbose Logging** ⚠️
   - Identified issue: Version logs use `print()` not debug
   - These always show regardless of DEBUG setting
   - Need to decide: Keep version logs or make them conditional?

### VERSION TRACKING - FIXED
| Script | Version | Status | Fix Applied |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| fader_script | v2.7.1 | Fixed | 60Hz update rate |
| pan_control | v1.5.0 | Untested | None |
| meter_script | v2.5.9 | Fixed | Connection timing |
| db_label | v1.3.3 | Untested | None |
| mute_button | v2.0.4 | Untested | None |
| db_meter_label | v2.6.2 | Untested | None |
| group_init | v1.16.0 | Untested | None |
| document_script | v2.7.5 | Untested | None |

### TESTING NEEDED:
- [ ] Meter displays levels correctly
- [ ] Meter status indicator changes color
- [ ] Fader double-tap animation is smooth
- [ ] No other regressions introduced
- [ ] Decide on version logging approach

### NEXT STEPS:
1. **Test the fixes**
2. **Decide on logging**: Keep version logs or make conditional?
3. **Complete Phase 1 testing**
4. **Only then proceed to Phase 2**

## State Saved: 2025-07-04 18:45 UTC
**Status**: Phase 1 bug fixes implemented, awaiting test results
**Next Action**: User to test meter, fader animation, and provide feedback on logging
**Critical**: Still need comprehensive testing before Phase 1 complete
