## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Fix refresh all button for track renumbering
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test the updated fix (v3 - no custom properties)
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Current Task: Fix Refresh All Track Renumbering
**Started**: 2025-07-05
**Branch**: fix/refresh-track-renumbering
**Status**: CODE_COMPLETE (v3)
**PR**: #14 updated

### Problem:
When inserting a new track at the beginning in Ableton Live, all tracks get renumbered (track 0 becomes track 1, etc.). The refresh all button doesn't properly reassign groups to the correct track numbers, causing faders to control the wrong tracks.

### Root Cause Found:
The groups were changing their `tag` property from "trackGroup" to "instance:trackNumber:trackType" after mapping. When refresh was triggered, it searched for groups with tag="trackGroup" but found 0 groups because they had all changed their tags.

### Solution Implemented (v3 - TouchOSC Compatible):
1. **document_script.lua v2.8.3**:
   - Added refresh sequencing with delay between clear and refresh
   - Send global stop_listen commands to ensure clean state
   - Use state machine for proper sequencing

2. **group_init.lua v1.16.3**:
   - **CRITICAL FIX**: Keep tag as "trackGroup" always
   - Store mapping info in script variables only (no custom properties)
   - Added `getInstance()` function for children
   - Uses only standard TouchOSC properties

3. **fader_script.lua v2.5.4**:
   - Updated to use parent's `getInstance()` method
   - Uses parent's `getTrackInfo()` to get track number/type

### Changes Made:
- ✅ Updated document_script.lua with refresh sequencing
- ✅ Fixed group_init.lua to keep tag unchanged
- ✅ Updated fader_script.lua to use safe methods
- ✅ Version bumps applied
- ✅ Debug logging disabled
- ✅ Removed custom properties approach (safer)

### Testing Needed:
1. Set up TouchOSC with multiple tracks (e.g., 8 tracks)
2. Verify all faders control correct tracks
3. Insert a new track at position 0 in Ableton
4. Press "Refresh All" button
5. Verify console shows groups being found and refreshed
6. Verify all faders now control the correct renumbered tracks

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Bug Fix (v3 - TouchOSC Compatible)
- Step: Code complete, awaiting test
- Status: CODE_COMPLETE

## Next Steps:
1. User tests the updated fix
2. If successful, merge PR #14
3. If issues remain, enable DEBUG=1 in scripts for detailed logs

## Previous Completed Tasks:
- Notify usage analysis (branch exists but seems abandoned)
- Remove centralized logging (PR #11 merged)
