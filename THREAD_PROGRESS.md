# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ WORKING ON PAN CONTROL RESTORATION:**
- [x] Currently working on: Optimized pan control performance by removing update()
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test optimized implementation in TouchOSC
- [ ] Branch: feature/restore-pan-features
- [ ] PR #18 - Implementation optimized, awaiting testing

## Current Task: Restore Missing Pan Control Features
**Started**: 2025-07-05  
**Branch**: feature/restore-pan-features
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED_NOT_TESTED
**PR**: #18 - Implementation optimized, awaiting testing

### Changes Made:
1. ✅ **pan_control.lua v1.5.2 → v1.5.3**:
   - **OPTIMIZATION**: Removed update() function for better performance
   - Color changes now handled in onValueChanged() only when value actually changes
   - No continuous update() calls - more efficient
   - All functionality preserved (color change & double-tap)
   - Added updateColor() helper function
   - Color updated in all relevant places:
     - When x value changes
     - On double-tap
     - When receiving OSC updates
     - On track changes

### Features Status:
1. **Color Change**: 
   - Gray (#646464) when pan is centered
   - Cyan (#34C1DC) when pan is off-center
   - Now updates only on value change (more efficient)
   - 0.01 threshold to avoid flickering

2. **Double-tap to Center**:
   - 300ms time window for double-tap detection
   - Centers pan to 0.5 (TouchOSC) / 0 (Ableton)
   - Sends OSC message to update Ableton
   - Updates color immediately on double-tap

3. **Logger Functionality**:
   - Intentionally removed (user confirmed)
   - Focus on performance and simplicity

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Verify version 1.5.3 loads in logs
- [ ] Verify pan color is gray when centered
- [ ] Verify pan color is cyan when off-center
- [ ] Test double-tap centers the pan to 0.5
- [ ] Confirm OSC message sent to Ableton on double-tap
- [ ] Test with regular tracks
- [ ] Test with return tracks
- [ ] Verify multi-connection support works
- [ ] Confirm no performance issues (update() removed)

## Previous PRs Pending:
1. **PR #16** - Group Interactivity Fix (ready to merge)
   - Simplified interactivity handling
   - Only sets fader, mute, pan as interactive
   - Meters/labels remain non-interactive
   
2. **PR #15** - Refresh Track Renumbering Fix (ready to merge)
   - Registration system for track groups
   - Fixes refresh when tracks renumbered in Ableton

## Next Steps:
1. User tests optimized pan features in TouchOSC
2. If issues found, fix and update version
3. Update CHANGELOG.md after testing success
4. Merge PR #18 after approval
5. Consider merging pending PRs #15 and #16

## Session Notes:
- User confirmed logger functionality was intentionally removed
- Optimized for performance by removing continuous update() calls
- Color changes now event-driven (onValueChanged) instead of polling
- All features preserved with better performance
