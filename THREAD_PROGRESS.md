## Current Task: Fix Group Interactivity Bug - COMPLETE
**Started**: 2025-07-05  
**Branch**: feature/fix-group-interactivity
**Status**: PRODUCTION_READY
**PR**: #16 - Ready to merge

### Solution Summary:
Simplified the interactivity handling to only set controls that need to become interactive (fader, mute, pan). Removed unnecessary code that was setting non-interactive states. Let TouchOSC editor handle non-interactive state for meters and labels.

### Final Changes:
1. ✅ **group_init.lua v1.16.4**:
   - Simplified `setGroupEnabled` function
   - Only handles fader, mute, pan interactivity
   - Removed unnecessary non-interactive code
   - **DEBUG = 0** (verified)

### Testing Results:
- ✅ Meters and labels remain non-interactive when group is mapped
- ✅ Fader, mute, pan become interactive correctly
- ✅ Clean, simple solution tested successfully

### Production Ready Checklist:
- ✅ All scripts have DEBUG = 0
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md updated
- ✅ PR description updated with simplified approach
- ✅ Testing successful
- ✅ No DEBUG flags or development artifacts remain
