# Thread Progress Tracking

## Current Status
- **Phase**: 3 - Script Functionality Testing
- **Step**: Group script fixed - removed pcall (not available in TouchOSC)
- **Date**: 2025-06-28
- **Branch**: feature/selective-connection-routing

## Important Context
- Document script (v2.5.9) tested and working
- Configuration and logger objects working perfectly
- Global refresh button (v1.2.2) working with proper logging
- **Test track**: "band_CG #"
- Group functionality WORKING (track found, controls enabled/disabled)
- **FIXED**: pcall error - removed pcall as it's not available in TouchOSC

## Phase 3 Progress

### Working Components
- ✅ Configuration text object
- ✅ Logger text object (for document script and refresh button)
- ✅ Document script attached to root (v2.5.9)
- ✅ Global refresh button (v1.2.2)
- ✅ Group script functionality (v1.6.5)
  - ✅ Finds track "CG #" correctly
  - ✅ Status indicator turns green
  - ✅ Controls enable/disable with alpha changes
  - ✅ No more fader value changes
  - ✅ Connection routing works
  - ✅ FIXED: pcall error
  - ❌ Logging to logger text object (console works)

### Known Issues
1. Group script logs appear in console but not in logger text object
2. Other scripts (document, refresh button) log correctly
3. Functionality is working despite logging issue

## Current Group Setup
- Group name: `band_CG #`
- Status indicator: Triangle button (non-interactive) - working ✅
- Controls dimming with alpha property - working ✅
- Track found at index 39 - working ✅

## Script Versions in Use
- **document_script.lua**: v2.5.9 (handles log_message notify)
- **group_init.lua**: v1.6.5 (fixed pcall error)
- **global_refresh_button.lua**: v1.2.2
- **fader_script.lua**: v2.0.0
- **meter_script.lua**: v2.0.0
- **mute_button.lua**: v1.0.0
- **pan_control.lua**: v1.0.0

## Latest Fix
**v1.6.5** - Removed `pcall` usage from the `getChild` function. TouchOSC's Lua environment doesn't include `pcall`, so we now use direct property access with proper null checks instead.

## Next Steps
1. Test the fixed group script to ensure pcall error is resolved
2. Accept that console logging works for debugging
3. Add remaining controls to test group:
   - Fader (already have?)
   - Meter group with level child
   - Mute button
   - Pan knob
4. Test each control with the working group
5. Move to production implementation

## Key Learning
- TouchOSC Lua environment has limitations - no pcall available
- The logging issue seems specific to how TouchOSC handles script output routing
- Since functionality works and console shows the logs, we can proceed with testing
