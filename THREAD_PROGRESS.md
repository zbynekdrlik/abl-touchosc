## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ MULTI-CONNECTION REGRESSION FIXED:**
- [x] Issue identified: Meter scripts lost multi-connection support after v1.2.0
- [x] Root cause: getConnectionIndex() function and connection filtering removed
- [x] Fixed: meter_script.lua v2.5.0
- [x] Fixed: db_meter_label.lua v2.7.0
- [x] Fixed: db_label.lua v1.4.0
- [x] PR #20 created and ready for review
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing and merge approval

## Implementation Status
- Phase: CRITICAL BUG FIX
- Status: COMPLETE - Ready for testing
- Branch: feature/restore-multi-connection-meter

## What Happened
After the v1.2.0 release (which added return track support), subsequent updates to meter scripts accidentally removed the multi-connection functionality. This caused all meters to respond to ALL Ableton instances instead of filtering by their assigned connection.

## Scripts Affected and Fixed
| Script | Old Version | Fixed Version | Changes |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| meter_script.lua | 2.4.1 | 2.5.0 | Restored getConnectionIndex() and connection filtering |
| db_meter_label.lua | 2.6.1 | 2.7.0 | Restored multi-connection support |
| db_label.lua | 1.3.1 | 1.4.0 | Restored multi-connection support |

## Scripts NOT Affected
These scripts maintained their multi-connection support:
- fader_script.lua ✅
- pan_control.lua ✅  
- mute_button.lua ✅
- group_init.lua ✅

## Technical Details
The regression occurred because:
1. Multi-connection support was added AFTER v1.2.0
2. When meter scripts were updated for other features, the old versions were used as base
3. The getConnectionIndex() function and connection filtering logic were not preserved

## Testing Required
Users with multiple Ableton instances should test:
1. Meters only respond to their assigned connection
2. Animation features still work correctly
3. Debug mode toggle (db_meter_label) still works
4. All other functionality preserved

## Next Steps
1. User tests the fix with multiple Ableton instances
2. Verify meters are properly isolated by connection
3. Merge PR #20 if testing successful
4. Consider adding automated tests to prevent similar regressions

## Lesson Learned
When updating scripts, always check for features added after the last major release and ensure they are preserved. The multi-connection support was a critical feature that should never have been lost.
