# Thread Progress Tracking

## Current Status
- **Phase**: 3 - Script Functionality Testing
- **Step**: Creating ONE complete track group with all controls
- **Date**: 2025-06-28
- **Branch**: feature/selective-connection-routing

## Important Context
- Document script (v2.5.8) tested and working
- Configuration and logger objects working perfectly
- Notify system implemented and tested
- Global refresh button (v1.2.1) working with proper logging
- **Changed approach**: Testing ONE complete group first before multiple scenarios

## Phase 3 Progress

### Setup Phase
- ✅ Configuration text object (working)
- ✅ Logger text object (working - shows messages correctly)
- ✅ Document script attached to root (v2.5.8)
- ✅ Notify system tested (refresh_all_groups notification works)
- ✅ Global refresh button (v1.2.1) - Working with proper logging
- ✅ Single track complete test instructions created
- [ ] Create ONE complete track group - IN PROGRESS

### Script Testing Phase (Single Group First)
- [ ] Test group script (band_Kick)
- [ ] Test fader script in group
- [ ] Test meter script in group
- [ ] Test mute button in group
- [ ] Test pan control in group
- [ ] Test all controls working together
- [ ] THEN test multiple group scenarios

## Current Task: Create Complete "band_Kick" Group
User needs to create ONE complete track group with:
1. Group container with status LED
2. Track label
3. Fader with script
4. Meter display with script
5. Mute button with script
6. Pan control with script

Detailed instructions in: `docs/single-track-complete-test.md`

## Script Versions in Use
- **document_script.lua**: v2.5.8 (updated)
- **group_init.lua**: v1.5.1
- **global_refresh_button.lua**: v1.2.1 (updated and working)
- **fader_script.lua**: v2.0.0
- **meter_script.lua**: v2.0.0
- **mute_button.lua**: v1.0.0
- **pan_control.lua**: v1.0.0

## Test Approach Change
Per user feedback, focusing on:
1. Get ONE complete track group working perfectly
2. Test all scripts in that single group
3. Verify full integration
4. Only then move to multiple group scenarios

## Next Steps
1. User creates single complete band_Kick group
2. Test initialization of all scripts
3. Test refresh to map the track
4. Test each control individually
5. Test all controls working together
6. Once perfect, then create additional test groups
