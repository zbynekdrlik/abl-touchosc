# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è STARTING PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION - PHASE 1**
- [ ] Currently working on: Performance optimization Phase 1 - Quick Wins
- [ ] Waiting for: Starting implementation
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Current Status (2025-07-04)

### Performance Optimization - Phase 1
- **Status**: üöÄ STARTING
- **Version**: 1.3.0 (target)
- **Branch**: feature/performance-optimization
- **Focus**: Quick wins for immediate impact

### Tasks - Phase 1
- [ ] Replace continuous update() with scheduled updates
- [ ] Fix debug code overhead
- [ ] Reduce status update frequency
- [ ] Test on production hardware
- [ ] Measure performance improvements

## Implementation Status - PERFORMANCE
- Phase: 1 of 4 - Quick Wins
- Step: Initial setup
- Status: PLANNING

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Optimization | Implemented | Tested | Performance Gain |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|---------|------------------|
| group_init | Scheduled updates | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Target: 30% |
| fader_script | Debug fixes | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Target: 20% |
| meter_script | Reduce frequency | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Target: 15% |
| All scripts | Debug guards | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | Target: 10% |

## Previous Work Complete
- ‚úÖ Return track feature (v1.2.0) - MERGED
- ‚úÖ Performance documentation created
- ‚úÖ Performance optimization plan ready

## Performance Issues Identified
1. **Excessive Update Frequency**: Scripts run 60-120Hz
2. **Debug Overhead**: String operations even when DEBUG=0
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Constant calculations
4. **Complex Calculations**: Smoothing on every frame

## Next Steps

### 1. Implement Quick Wins üéØ
Priority order:
1. group_init.lua - Remove continuous update()
2. fader_script.lua - Fix debug overhead
3. meter_script.lua - Reduce update frequency
4. All scripts - Proper DEBUG guards

### 2. Testing Protocol
- Baseline performance with current version
- Test with 8, 16, 24, 32 tracks
- Measure CPU usage and response time
- Document improvements

## Key Decisions

1. **Phased approach** - Start with easy wins
2. **Maintain functionality** - No feature regression
3. **Measure everything** - Data-driven optimization

## Branch Status

- Implementation: ‚è≥ Starting
- Documentation: ‚úÖ Ready
- Testing: ‚ùå Not started
- **Ready for merge: NO**

## Performance Targets

- Response time: < 100ms (from ~300ms)
- CPU usage: < 30% (from ~80%)
- Smooth operation: 16+ tracks
- Frame rate: 30+ FPS consistent
