# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ ONLY ONE BUG FIXED - MANY ISSUES REMAIN**
- [x] Currently working on: Fixed OSC pattern issue for mute button
- [ ] Waiting for: Comprehensive testing of ALL other features
- [ ] Blocked by: Multiple untested/broken features

## Current Status (2025-07-04 14:15 UTC)

### WHAT WAS FIXED:
- **Mute button OSC patterns** - Added to template, now receives updates from Ableton
- This was ONE fix out of MANY issues

### STILL NEEDS WORK:
- Mute script - User not satisfied with current implementation
- Other controls - Not fully tested
- Performance issues - Unknown if actually improved
- All other features - Need comprehensive testing

### KNOWN ISSUES THAT MAY STILL BE BROKEN:
- Fader behavior - Not confirmed if sync delay fix works
- DB label updates - Not confirmed if volume listener works
- Meter accuracy - Not confirmed if OSC format fix works
- Pan control - Not tested
- Track switching - Not tested if all controls update properly
- Double-tap features - Not tested
- Performance under load - Not tested

## Current Script Versions (STILL IN DEBUG MODE)

| Script | Version | Status | Issue |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| document_script.lua | v2.7.4 | ❓ Untested | - |
| group_init.lua | v1.15.9 | ❓ Untested | - |
| fader_script.lua | v2.6.0 | ❓ Untested | Sync delay fix not verified |
| meter_script.lua | v2.5.6 | ❓ Untested | OSC format fix not verified |
| pan_control.lua | v1.4.2 | ❓ Untested | - |
| db_label.lua | v1.3.2 | ❓ Untested | Volume listener not verified |
| db_meter_label.lua | v2.6.1 | ❓ Untested | OSC format fix not verified |
| mute_button.lua | v2.0.2 | ⚠️ Partially working | User not satisfied |
| global_refresh_button.lua | v1.5.1 | ❓ Untested | - |

## What We Actually Know

### CONFIRMED:
- Mute button NOW receives OSC messages (after template fix)
- Template was missing OSC receive patterns

### NOT CONFIRMED:
- Whether mute button behaves correctly in all scenarios
- Whether any other fixes actually work
- Whether performance is actually improved
- Whether there are additional bugs we haven't found

## Next Steps Required

### Testing Still Needed:
1. Test EVERY control thoroughly
2. Verify fader doesn't jump back
3. Verify DB label shows continuous updates
4. Verify meters show correct levels
5. Test track switching behavior
6. Test double-tap features
7. Test with multiple tracks for performance
8. Identify what's wrong with mute script that user is unhappy with

### DO NOT ASSUME:
- That any feature works without explicit testing
- That fixing one bug means others are fixed
- That user is satisfied without explicit confirmation

## State Saved: 2025-07-04 14:15 UTC
**Status**: ONE bug fixed (OSC patterns), MANY issues remain
**Next Action**: Continue systematic testing of all features
**Warning**: Do not mark as complete without full testing confirmation
