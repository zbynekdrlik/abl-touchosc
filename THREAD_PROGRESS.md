## Current Task: Fix Refresh Track Renumbering
**Started**: 2025-07-05
**Branch**: feature/fix-refresh-track-renumbering  
**Status**: CODE_UPDATED
**PR**: Ready to create

### Problem:
When inserting a new track at the beginning in Ableton, all tracks get renumbered but the "Refresh All" button doesn't properly reassign groups to the correct track numbers, causing faders to control the wrong tracks.

### Solution Implemented:
1. ✅ Updated group_init.lua v1.16.1:
   - Fixed clear_mapping to reset tag to "trackGroup" 
   - Added notification to children about mapping_cleared
   - Ensures no stale track references remain

2. ✅ Updated fader_script.lua v2.5.3:
   - Added handling for mapping_cleared notification
   - Cancels any ongoing animations when mapping is cleared
   - Ensures fader always reads fresh track info from parent tag

3. ✅ Updated document_script.lua v2.8.3:
   - Added 100ms delay between clear and refresh operations
   - Ensures all scripts have time to process the clear before new mappings
   - Improved status feedback during refresh sequence

### Changes Made:
- **group_init.lua**: Reset tag on clear_mapping, notify children
- **fader_script.lua**: Handle mapping_cleared notification
- **document_script.lua**: Add delay between clear and refresh phases

### Testing Instructions:
1. Open Ableton with multiple tracks (e.g., 4-8 tracks)
2. Map tracks in TouchOSC and verify faders control correct tracks
3. Insert a new track at the beginning in Ableton
4. Press "Refresh All" button in TouchOSC
5. Verify that:
   - Status shows "Clearing..." then "Waiting..." then "Refreshing..." then "Ready"
   - All faders now control the correct renumbered tracks
   - No faders control the wrong track

## Previous Task: Notify Usage Analysis & Cleanup (COMPLETE)
**Completed**: 2025-07-04
**Branch**: feature/notify-usage-analysis (merged)
**PR**: #12 - Merged

### Summary:
- Analyzed all scripts for notify() usage
- Confirmed notify is only used for inter-script communication
- No high-frequency usage found
- Removed dead configuration_updated handler

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Bug Fixes & Improvements
- Step: Track renumbering refresh fix
- Status: CODE_COMPLETE
