# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] All band_CG # controls fully tested and working
- [x] Multi-connection routing working perfectly (connection 2)
- [x] All scripts updated with proper versions
- [x] Logging system unified (all use root:notify)
- [ ] Currently: Ready to create master groups for testing
- [ ] Waiting for: User to create master_Hand1 # group
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: 3 - Script Functionality Testing
- Step: All band controls tested, ready for master controls
- Status: TESTING COMPLETE FOR BAND
- Date: 2025-06-29

## Testing Summary - band_CG # Group

### ✅ FULLY TESTED AND WORKING:
1. **Group Script v1.9.6**
   - Properly maps tracks
   - No visual corruption
   - Status indicator working
   - Track label shows "CG" correctly

2. **Fader v2.3.5**
   - Multi-connection routing (connection 2)
   - Sophisticated movement scaling
   - Double-tap to 0dB
   - Never moves on assumptions

3. **Meter v2.2.2**
   - Exact calibration preserved
   - Color thresholds working
   - Multi-connection routing
   - Responds only to connection_band

4. **Mute Button v1.8.0**
   - State tracking perfect
   - Touch detection prevents loops
   - Multi-connection routing
   - Uses logger output

5. **Pan Control v1.3.2**
   - Double-tap to center
   - Visual color feedback
   - Multi-connection routing
   - Simple and clean implementation

## Next Phase: Master Controls Testing
Create master_Hand1 # group with:
- Same 5 controls (fader, meter, mute, pan, label)
- Connection 3 routing
- Test isolation between band/master

## Script Versions Summary
- **document_script.lua**: v2.6.0 ✅ (removed print from log function)
- **group_init.lua**: v1.9.6 ✅ (no visual corruption, label working)
- **global_refresh_button.lua**: v1.4.0 ✅ (tested and working)
- **fader_script.lua**: v2.3.5 ✅ (never moves on assumptions)
- **meter_script.lua**: v2.2.2 ✅ (calibration preserved)
- **mute_button.lua**: v1.8.0 ✅ (uses root:notify for logging)
- **pan_control.lua**: v1.3.2 ✅ (simple with all features)

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Script Isolation
- Scripts are completely isolated in TouchOSC
- Each script reads configuration directly
- Communication only via notify() and properties

### 2. Connection Routing
- Each instance (band/master) has dedicated connection
- Scripts determine connection from parent tag
- OSC messages routed with connection tables

### 3. Visual Design Preservation
- Group script only toggles interactivity
- Never changes control colors/opacity
- User's visual design remains intact

### 4. State Management
- Controls preserve position on init
- Only change on user action or OSC update
- Never assume default positions

### 5. Logging Architecture
- All scripts use root:notify("log_message", ...)
- Document script manages logger text
- Console printing separate for debugging

## Critical Learnings Applied

### TouchOSC Specifics:
1. Buttons don't have text property
2. Children is userdata, not Lua table
3. Scripts can't share functions
4. Must read config directly in each script

### Best Practices:
1. Version every script change
2. Log version on startup
3. Test with actual logs
4. Never move controls on assumptions
5. Preserve user's visual design

## Future Development Phases

### Phase 4: Production Scaling
- Create all track groups (8 band, 8 master)
- Test with full 100+ track project
- Verify performance and stability

### Phase 5: Logging Optimization
- Implement debug levels
- Reduce verbose initialization
- Clean production logging
- Optional debug mode

### Phase 6: Advanced Features
- Track color synchronization
- Solo/record arm buttons
- Send controls
- Device parameter control

## Configuration Reminder
```
connection_band: 2
connection_master: 3
```

## Summary
Phase 3 testing is complete for band controls. All scripts are working perfectly with multi-connection routing, proper state management, and unified logging. Ready to scale to master controls and then full production.
