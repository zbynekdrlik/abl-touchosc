# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ PR #27 IN PROGRESS:**
- [ ] Currently working on: Fix Android tablet refresh timing issues with 200 tracks
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing of improved refresh mechanism
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## ACTIVE WORK: ANDROID REFRESH TIMING FIX
### Problem Identified:
- Android tablets are slower than Windows TouchOSC
- With 200 tracks, some faders not mapping during refresh
- 100ms delay between clear and refresh too short for slower devices
- No retry mechanism if mapping fails

### Solution Implemented:
1. **Increased Timing**: ✅
   - `REFRESH_WAIT_TIME` increased from 100ms to 300ms
   - Added 50ms pre-query delay to ensure groups ready
   - Added 500ms verification delay after queries

2. **Retry Mechanism**: ✅
   - Tracks unmapped groups during refresh
   - Verifies all groups mapped after queries
   - Retries up to 3 times with 1s delay
   - Shows retry status in UI

3. **Updated Scripts**: ✅
   - `document_script.lua` v2.11.0 - Improved timing & retry logic
   - `group_init.lua` v1.18.0 - Notifies when successfully mapped

4. **Testing Required**: ❌
   - [ ] Test on Android tablet with 200 tracks
   - [ ] Verify all faders map on first attempt
   - [ ] Test retry mechanism if any fail
   - [ ] Compare performance vs Windows TouchOSC

## PENDING WORK: DUPLICATE TRACK NAMES (PR #26)
### Status: READY FOR TESTING
- [x] Centralized track names retrieval implemented
- [ ] Needs testing before merge

## COMPLETED WORK: DOUBLE-CLICK MUTE (PR #24)
### Final Status: READY FOR MERGE
- [x] Double-click mute protection COMPLETE AND WORKING
- [x] Documentation cleanup COMPLETE
- [x] Experimental files removed
- [x] README fully documented with two-control approach
- [x] CHANGELOG finalized for v1.5.0
- [x] Ready for merge

- Result: Created PR #27 with timing improvements
- Next Required: Test on Android tablet and provide logs

## NEXT STEPS
1. User tests PR #27 on Android tablet with 200 tracks
2. Check if all faders map correctly on first attempt
3. If any fail, verify retry mechanism works
4. Provide logs showing success/retry behavior
5. Once confirmed working:
   - Merge PR #27 (Android timing fix)
   - Test and merge PR #26 (duplicate calls fix)
   - Merge PR #24 (double-click mute)
   - Create v1.5.0 release
