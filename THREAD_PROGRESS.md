# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ FADER WORKING BUT PERFORMANCE GOALS UNCLEAR**
- [x] Currently working on: Reviewing if performance optimization goals were achieved
- [ ] Waiting for: Analysis of original performance goals vs current implementation
- [ ] Blocked by: Need to compare feature branch optimizations with what's actually implemented

## Current Status (2025-07-04 15:37 UTC)

### USER CONFIRMATION:
- **Fader IS working correctly** - controls Ableton volume properly
- **Meter spam is reduced** - notification throttling working
- **Question**: Did we achieve performance goals or just revert to main branch?

### WORKING COMPONENTS:
- **Fader** (v2.6.4) - Working correctly with Ableton
- **Meter** (v2.5.7) - Working with reduced notification spam
- **Mute button** (v2.0.3) - Working correctly
- **Pan control** (v1.4.2) - Working correctly  
- **DB label** (v1.3.2) - OK
- **DB meter label** (v2.6.1) - OK

### STILL BROKEN:
- **Status indicator** - Not working at all (script unknown)

## Performance Branch Original Goals

### Need to verify:
1. **Event-driven architecture** - No continuous polling
2. **Reduced update frequency** - Only update when values change
3. **Optimized OSC handling** - Efficient message processing
4. **Connection routing** - Multi-instance support
5. **Debouncing** - Prevent excessive updates
6. **Activity monitoring** - Group fade on inactivity

### Current Fader Implementation Check:
- ✅ Has connection routing (multi-instance)
- ✅ Has movement scaling feature (performance feature?)
- ✅ Has double-tap to unity (feature enhancement)
- ❓ Event-driven vs polling?
- ❓ Update frequency optimization?
- ❓ Debouncing implementation?

## Current Script Versions

| Script | Version | Status | Performance Features? |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------------|
| document_script.lua | v2.7.4 | ✅ Working | Connection routing |
| group_init.lua | v1.15.9 | ✅ Working | Activity monitoring, debouncing |
| fader_script.lua | v2.6.4 | ✅ Working | Movement scaling, connection routing |
| meter_script.lua | v2.5.7 | ✅ Working | Event-driven, notification throttling |
| pan_control.lua | v1.4.2 | ✅ Working | Unknown |
| db_label.lua | v1.3.2 | ✅ Working | Unknown |
| db_meter_label.lua | v2.6.1 | ✅ Working | Unknown |
| mute_button.lua | v2.0.3 | ✅ Working | Unknown |
| status_indicator | ??? | ❌ BROKEN | Unknown script |

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **What were the original performance problems?**
   - CPU usage?
   - Network traffic?
   - UI responsiveness?
   - Multi-instance overhead?

2. **What optimizations were planned?**
   - Event-driven updates
   - Reduced polling
   - Debouncing
   - Connection pooling

3. **What's actually implemented now?**
   - Movement scaling (not performance related?)
   - Connection routing (performance for multi-instance)
   - Debug logging (actually adds overhead!)
   - Activity monitoring (performance feature)

4. **Did we keep optimizations or revert?**
   - Need to compare main branch vs current
   - Check for polling vs event-driven
   - Verify update frequencies

## Next Analysis Steps

### 1. Compare Fader Scripts
- Main branch v2.4.1 vs Current v2.6.4
- Identify performance-specific changes
- Check update() function behavior

### 2. Check Original Branch Goals
- Review initial commits on feature branch
- Look for performance problem description
- Verify if goals were met

### 3. Performance Testing Needed?
- CPU usage comparison
- Network traffic analysis
- Multi-instance efficiency

## State Saved: 2025-07-04 15:37 UTC
**Status**: Fader working but unsure if performance goals achieved
**Next Action**: Compare main vs feature branch implementations
**Critical Question**: Did we optimize performance or just fix bugs?
