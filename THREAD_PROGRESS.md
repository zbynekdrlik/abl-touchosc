# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ NEW FEATURE IN PROGRESS:**
- [ ] Currently working on: Fader position color indicator
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing of color indicator
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: NEW FEATURE - FADER POSITION COLOR INDICATOR
- Step: Implementation completed, awaiting testing
- Status: IMPLEMENTING
- Branch: feature/fader-position-color-indicator

## New Feature: Fader Position Color Indicator (v1.4.1)
**Feature Request:** Change db_label color when fader is not at 0dB position

**Implementation:**
- Updated db_label.lua to version 1.4.1
- Added color indicator that changes when fader is moved from 0dB
- White color (1, 1, 1) when at 0dB (±0.1dB tolerance)
- Yellow color (1, 0.8, 0) when fader is moved away from 0dB
- Clean implementation with no regression risk

**Changes:**
- v1.4.0: Initial implementation with gray default color
- v1.4.1: Changed default color to white for better contrast

**Files Modified:**
- scripts/track/db_label.lua (v1.3.2 → v1.4.1)

## Testing Required
- [ ] Verify label shows yellow when fader is moved from 0dB
- [ ] Verify label returns to white when fader is at 0dB (±0.1dB)
- [ ] Test with different track types (regular and return tracks)
- [ ] Confirm no regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Test color changes are smooth and responsive

## Previous Work (Completed)
### Feedback Loop Prevention (v2.5.4) ✅
**Issue:** When moving fader in Ableton:
1. Ableton sends OSC to TouchOSC to update fader position
2. TouchOSC receives and updates its fader (self.values.x)
3. This triggers onValueChanged() which sends OSC back to Ableton
4. Creates feedback loop making Ableton fader jumpy/laggy

**Solution:** Added `updating_from_osc` flag to prevent sending OSC when updating from received OSC:
- Set flag before updating self.values.x in onReceiveOSC()
- Check flag in onValueChanged() and skip sending if set
- Also set flag in update() function during sync operations

**Testing Result:** ✅ User confirmed fix is working - no more feedback loop!

## Next Steps
1. User to test the color indicator feature in TouchOSC
2. Adjust colors or tolerance if needed based on feedback
3. Update documentation if feature is approved
4. Merge PR after successful testing

## Notes
- Simple, clean implementation focusing on visual feedback
- No changes to fader behavior or OSC communication
- Uses TouchOSC Color constructor as per rules
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- White/yellow provides clear visual contrast
