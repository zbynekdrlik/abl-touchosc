## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Fixed mute button sending commands during init
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test mute button fix (v2.7.1)
- [ ] Blocked by: Need test confirmation

## CRITICAL BUG FIXED IN v2.7.1
**Mute button was sending commands during refresh!**

Found the root cause: The mute button's `updateVisualState()` was changing `self.values.x` during init/refresh, which triggered `onValueChanged()` and sent unwanted `/live/track/set/mute` commands to Ableton.

## The Fix Applied
Added `isUserInteraction` flag to distinguish between:
- User clicks (should send commands)
- Programmatic changes (should NOT send commands)

Now the mute button only sends commands when:
1. User physically touches the button (`touch` = true)
2. The value changes while touching

This matches how pan control already works correctly.

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Android tablet fix - TESTING NEEDED
- Step: Mute button fix implemented (v2.7.1)
- Status: AWAITING TEST CONFIRMATION
