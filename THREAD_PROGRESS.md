## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ WORKING ON: Notify Usage Analysis**
- [x] Currently working on: Analyzing notify usage across all scripts
- [ ] Waiting for: User review of notify usage report
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Current Task: Notify Usage Analysis
**Started**: 2025-07-04
**Branch**: feature/notify-usage-analysis  
**Status**: ANALYSIS_COMPLETE
**PR**: Not yet created

### Completed:
1. ✅ Analyzed all scripts for notify() usage
2. ✅ Created comprehensive report on current usage
3. ✅ Documented why notify is still needed
4. ✅ Provided alternative approaches
5. ✅ Made recommendations

### Key Findings:
- **Notify is NO LONGER used for logging** (removed in v2.8.1)
- **Notify IS used for inter-script communication:**
  - Configuration registration
  - Global refresh coordination  
  - Parent-child track mapping updates
  - Event broadcasting

### Report Location:
- `/docs/notify-usage-analysis.md`

## Previous Task: Remove Centralized Logging (COMPLETE)
**Completed**: 2025-07-04
**Branch**: feature/remove-centralized-logging (merged)
**PR**: #11 - Merged

### Summary:
- Removed all centralized logging via notify()
- Each script now has local log() function with DEBUG=0
- All functionality preserved
- Production ready

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Code Analysis & Documentation
- Step: Notify usage analysis complete
- Status: ANALYSIS_COMPLETE

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Notify Analysis | ✅ | All scripts analyzed |
| Report Generation | ✅ | Comprehensive report created |
| Alternatives Documented | ✅ | 4 alternatives provided |
| Recommendations | ✅ | Keep notify for inter-script comm |

## Next Steps:
1. User reviews notify usage report
2. Decide if any changes needed
3. If changes needed, implement chosen alternative
4. If no changes, merge documentation

## Recommendation:
**Keep notify() for inter-script communication** - it's working well, uses TouchOSC's intended mechanism, and maintains clean architecture with loose coupling.
