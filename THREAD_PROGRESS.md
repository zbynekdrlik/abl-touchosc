# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Phase document created: `docs/return-tracks-phases.md`
- [ ] Currently in Phase 0.3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Waiting for: User to run `return_track_test.py` script
- [ ] Next: Analyze test results and choose implementation approach (A/B/C)

## Implementation Status
- Phase: 0 - Discovery & Testing
- Step: 0.3 - Testing & Validation
- Status: WAITING FOR TEST EXECUTION

## Feature: Add Send/Return Track Control
Enable control of Ableton's send/return tracks in addition to regular audio/MIDI tracks.

### Phase 0 Progress
- [x] 0.1 Research & Documentation ‚úÖ
- [x] 0.2 Test Script Development ‚úÖ
- [ ] 0.3 Testing & Validation ‚è≥

### Research Findings
1. **AbletonOSC claims support** - Documentation mentions "audio, MIDI, return or master track"
2. **No clear documentation** - How to access return tracks is undocumented
3. **Legacy LiveOSC had explicit support** - Used `/live/return/` namespace
4. **Testing required** - Need to determine actual implementation

### Key Questions (To be answered by test script)
1. Are return tracks indexed after regular tracks?
2. Do they use same `/live/track/` commands?
3. Is there a separate API for return tracks?

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Researched | Documented | Implementation | Tested | 
|-----------|------------|------------|----------------|--------|
| Return track analysis | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Test scripts | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚è≥ |
| Phase planning | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | N/A | N/A |
| Access method | üîÑ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| TouchOSC integration | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |

## Previous Task Completed
- [x] db_meter_label.lua v2.4.0 - Production ready
- [x] PR #7 merged to main
- [x] Feature complete - no more work needed

## Documentation Created
- `docs/return-tracks-analysis.md` - Initial research findings
- `docs/return-tracks-implementation-plan.md` - Technical implementation approach
- `docs/return-tracks-phases.md` - Comprehensive 7-phase implementation plan

## Scripts Created
- `return_track_test.py` - Discovery script to test AbletonOSC behavior
- TouchOSC test functions - For manual testing if needed

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **User Action Required:**
   - Run `python return_track_test.py` in test environment
   - Ensure Ableton Live is open with AbletonOSC loaded
   - Create test project with regular tracks + return tracks
   - Share complete test output

2. **Based on Test Results:**
   - **Option A (Extended Indexing)**: Return tracks use indices after regular tracks
   - **Option B (Separate API)**: Return tracks have dedicated commands
   - **Option C (Not Supported)**: Need to document limitation and explore workarounds

3. **Then Begin Phase 1:**
   - Core implementation based on chosen approach
   - Version 2.0.0 for major functionality addition

## User Context
User wants to control send/return tracks in Ableton, not just regular tracks. They suspect AbletonOSC doesn't fully implement return track control yet.

## Testing Plan Details

### Test 1: Track Indexing Discovery
```
/live/song/get/num_tracks
/live/song/get/track_names
```
See if return tracks appear in the count and names.

### Test 2: Extended Index Access
If we have 8 regular tracks + 2 returns:
```
/live/track/get/name 8
/live/track/get/name 9
```
Check if indices 8 and 9 access return tracks.

### Test 3: Property Identification
Query track properties to identify return tracks:
```
/live/track/get/has_audio_input [index]
/live/track/get/available_input_routing_types [index]
```

### Test 4: Alternative Commands
Check for undocumented return-specific commands:
```
/live/song/get/return_tracks
/live/song/get/num_return_tracks
/live/return/get/name 0
```

## Research Resources
- AbletonOSC GitHub: https://github.com/ideoforms/AbletonOSC
- Live Object Model docs: Ableton's official API documentation
- Legacy LiveOSC2: Shows how return tracks were handled before
- Forum discussions: Users asking about return track access

## Thread Handoff Notes
- Phase document exists with complete 7-phase plan
- Currently waiting for test script execution
- All research and planning complete
- Ready to implement once test results confirm approach
