# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fader fully working with multi-connection routing (v2.3.4)
- [x] Meter fully working with calibration preserved (v2.2.2)
- [x] Group script fixed - no visual corruption (v1.9.6)
- [x] Track label working correctly (shows "CG" or "???")
- [ ] Currently: Ready to test mute button
- [ ] Waiting for: User to add mute control to band_CG # group
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: 3 - Script Functionality Testing
- Step: Testing individual controls on band_CG # group
- Status: TESTING
- Date: 2025-06-28

## Current Testing Progress
### band_CG # Group Setup
- ✅ Group created with status indicator
- ✅ Group script v1.9.6 attached (fixed runtime errors)
- ✅ OSC receive pattern set
- ✅ Successfully mapped to Track 39 (CG #)
- ✅ Status indicator GREEN
- ✅ Controls enabled (5 controls)
- ✅ Track label shows "CG" correctly

### Fader Control
- ✅ Control type: Fader
- ✅ Name: fader
- ✅ OSC receive pattern: /live/track/get/volume
- ✅ Script: fader_script.lua v2.3.4
- ✅ FULLY WORKING with all sophisticated features
- ✅ No color changes - visual design preserved
- ✅ Multi-connection routing working (connection 2)

### Meter Control  
- ✅ Control type: Fader (TouchOSC uses faders for meters)
- ✅ Name: meter
- ✅ OSC receive pattern: /live/track/get/output_meter_level
- ✅ Script: meter_script.lua v2.2.2
- ✅ FULLY WORKING with exact calibration preserved
- ✅ Color thresholds working (-12dB yellow, -3dB red)
- ✅ Multi-connection routing working (connection 2)

### Track Label
- ✅ Control type: Label
- ✅ Name: track_label
- ✅ Shows "CG" when track found (extracts from "CG #")
- ✅ Shows "???" when track not found
- ✅ Updates correctly on refresh

### Remaining Controls to Test
- ⏳ Mute button - Ready to add
- ⏳ Pan control - Not tested

## Mute Button Setup Instructions
**To add mute control:**
1. Add a **Button** control to band_CG # group
2. Name it exactly: **mute**
3. Set OSC receive pattern to: `/live/track/get/mute`
4. Attach script: mute_button.lua (v1.1.0)

## Critical Issues Fixed in This Thread

### 1. Script Isolation Issue
**Problem**: Fader tried to call `documentScript.getConnectionForInstance()`
**Solution**: Scripts are completely isolated in TouchOSC - each script must read config directly
**Fixed in**: fader v2.2.0

### 2. Tag Format Change
**Problem**: Group script now uses "instance:track" format (e.g., "band:39") but controls expected just "39"
**Solution**: Extract track number from new format in onReceiveOSC
**Fixed in**: fader v2.3.1, meter v2.2.0

### 3. OSC Send Parameter Issue
**Problem**: Fader only sent track number without volume value
**Solution**: Fixed sendOSCRouted to properly send both parameters
**Fixed in**: fader v2.3.2

### 4. Logger Verbosity
**Problem**: Volume changes spamming the logger
**Solution**: Moved volume change logs to debug mode only
**Fixed in**: fader v2.3.3

### 5. Visual Corruption Issue
**Problem**: Group script was changing control colors/opacity when enabling/disabling
**Solution**: Removed ALL visual changes, only toggle interactivity
**Fixed in**: group v1.9.0

### 6. Track Label Not Updating
**Problem**: Label wasn't changing to "???" when track not found
**Solution**: Fixed runtime error with pairs() on children userdata
**Fixed in**: group v1.9.6

## Script Versions
- **document_script.lua**: v2.5.9 ✅ (centralized logging working)
- **group_init.lua**: v1.9.6 ✅ (fixed runtime errors, label working)
- **global_refresh_button.lua**: v1.4.0 ✅ (tested and working)
- **fader_script.lua**: v2.3.4 ✅ (FULLY TESTED AND WORKING)
- **meter_script.lua**: v2.2.2 ✅ (FULLY TESTED AND WORKING)
- **mute_button.lua**: v1.1.0 ❌ (not tested)
- **pan_control.lua**: v1.1.0 ❌ (not tested)

## Key Learnings

### TouchOSC Script Isolation
1. Scripts CANNOT share variables or functions
2. Each script must be completely self-contained
3. Communication only via:
   - `notify()` - for messages between scripts
   - Parent/child properties
   - Reading shared controls (like configuration text)

### Configuration Pattern
Scripts that need connection info must:
1. Find the configuration control: `root:findByName("configuration", true)`
2. Parse the text directly
3. Cannot rely on helper functions from other scripts

### OSC Patterns
- Send format: `/path/to/command track_number value connection_table`
- Receive must handle exact format expected by Ableton
- Connection routing requires explicit connection table

### Visual Design Preservation
- Group script should ONLY toggle interactivity
- Never change colors or opacity of controls
- Status indicator is sufficient for visual feedback
- Preserve user's carefully tuned appearance

### Children Access in TouchOSC
- `self.children` is userdata, not a Lua table
- Cannot use `pairs()` to iterate
- Must access children directly by name
- Use safe access patterns to avoid runtime errors

## Next Steps
1. Add mute button to band_CG # group
2. Test mute functionality with multi-connection routing
3. Add and test pan control
4. Create master_Hand1 # group with connection 3
5. Test multi-instance routing between band and master

## Configuration Reminder
Current real-world configuration:
```
connection_band: 2
connection_master: 3
```

## Testing Checklist for band_CG #
- [x] Group initializes correctly
- [x] Refresh maps track successfully
- [x] Track label updates correctly
- [x] Fader controls volume
- [x] Meter shows levels with correct calibration
- [x] Meter responds only to connection_band messages
- [x] Meter colors match dB thresholds
- [x] Visual appearance preserved after refresh
- [ ] Mute button works
