# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fixed AbletonOSC fork - listeners now fully implemented!
- [x] Group init script v1.14.3 working perfectly
- [x] Status indicators turn GREEN for both track types
- [x] User confirmed AbletonOSC listeners work (no more errors!)
- [x] All child scripts updated to support return tracks
- [ ] Ready for full system testing with return tracks

## Major Update: ALL SCRIPTS UPDATED! üéâ

### What Was Just Completed:
1. **Updated ALL child scripts to v2.4.0+** with return track support:
   - fader_script.lua (v2.4.0) - Volume control with return track support
   - meter_script.lua (v2.3.0) - Meter display with return track support
   - mute_button.lua (v1.9.0) - Mute control with return track support
   - pan_control.lua (v1.4.0) - Pan control with return track support
   - db_meter_label.lua (v2.5.0) - dBFS display with return track support

2. **All scripts now check parent's trackType** to determine regular vs return
3. **All scripts route to correct OSC paths** based on track type
4. **Unified approach maintained** - same connection, auto-detection works

### Next Steps for User:
1. **Test the complete system** with return tracks
2. **Verify all controls work** - fader, meter, mute, pan, dB display
3. **Check real-time updates** - parameters should update when changed in Ableton
4. **Report any issues** with specific controls

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
1. **Visual feedback** - Status indicators turn green when mapped
2. **Track detection** - Both regular and return tracks detected correctly
3. **Track mapping** - Both types map to correct indices
4. **AbletonOSC fork** - Full return track support with listeners!
5. **All control scripts** - Updated with return track support

### üîß Ready for Testing:
1. **Complete return track functionality** - All controls should work
2. **Real-time parameter sync** - Faders/meters/mute/pan should update
3. **Multi-instance support** - Multiple TouchOSC instances with returns

## Implementation Status
- Phase: FULL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
- Step: Ready for comprehensive testing
- Status: All scripts updated, awaiting user testing

## Code Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:
1. **group_init.lua v1.14.3** - Fully working with return tracks
2. **AbletonOSC fork** - Return track listeners implemented
3. **fader_script.lua v2.4.0** - Return track volume control
4. **meter_script.lua v2.3.0** - Return track meter display
5. **mute_button.lua v1.9.0** - Return track mute control
6. **pan_control.lua v1.4.0** - Return track pan control
7. **db_meter_label.lua v2.5.0** - Return track dBFS display

### üìù Documentation Updates Needed:
1. Update README with return track support announcement
2. Document the unified approach (no separate scripts needed)
3. Add return track setup instructions

## Technical Details

### How Return Tracks Work:
1. **Parent group stores trackType** - "regular" or "return"
2. **Child scripts check trackType** to determine OSC paths
3. **Same connection used** - band/master instance determines connection
4. **Auto-detection** - Group script queries both track types and maps correctly

### OSC Path Differences:
- Regular tracks: `/live/track/get/*` and `/live/track/set/*`
- Return tracks: `/live/return/get/*` and `/live/return/set/*`

## Summary
The return track implementation is now COMPLETE! All scripts have been updated to support both regular and return tracks using a unified approach. The AbletonOSC fork has been fixed with proper listener support. The system is ready for comprehensive testing with return tracks in a real Ableton Live session.
