# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Meter fluency and status indicator issues
- [ ] Waiting for: User still not satisfied with meter performance
- [ ] Blocked by: Need deeper investigation of meter differences

## Current Status (2025-07-04 19:30 UTC)

### ⚠️ PHASE 1 BUG FIXES - PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**COMPLETED FIXES:**
1. **Fader Movement (v2.7.2)** ✅ WORKING
   - Fixed double-tap overshoot at 0dB
   - User confirmed "Fader movement is ok"
   
2. **Verbose Logging** ✅ FIXED
   - Fixed in ALL scripts to respect DEBUG flag:
   - meter_script v2.6.1
   - fader_script v2.7.2
   - group_init v1.16.1
   - db_label v1.3.4
   - pan_control v1.5.1
   - db_meter_label v2.6.3
   - global_refresh_button v1.5.2
   - document_script v2.7.6

**UNRESOLVED ISSUES:**
1. **Meter Not Fluent** ❌ STILL NOT GOOD
   - User says: "still not fluent as in main branch"
   - v2.6.1 removed throttling but still not satisfactory
   - Need deeper investigation of differences
   
2. **Status Indicator** ❌ NOT WORKING AT ALL
   - Always brown, no color changes visible
   - Meter logs show color calculations working
   - Likely TouchOSC meter doesn't support color property

### VERSION TRACKING
| Script | Version | Status | Issue |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| fader_script | v2.7.2 | ✅ WORKING | None |
| meter_script | v2.6.1 | ❌ NOT FLUENT | Still laggy |
| All others | Updated | ✅ LOGGING FIXED | None |

### KEY DIFFERENCES FOUND (Main vs Feature)

**Main Branch Meter (v2.3.1):**
- Simple, direct implementation
- No deferred connection setup
- No notification system (parent.notify)
- Direct color application
- Uses log() function that prints to console

**Feature Branch Meter (v2.6.1):**
- Complex connection management
- Deferred setup that might miss messages
- Parent notification system adds overhead
- More debug code even when DEBUG=0
- Different logging approach

### NEXT INVESTIGATION NEEDED:
1. **Profile meter performance** - where is the lag?
2. **Test without parent notifications** completely
3. **Compare exact OSC message handling timing**
4. **Try different meter control type** for status
5. **Consider reverting to main branch meter approach**

### USER'S FEEDBACK TIMELINE:
- 19:04 UTC: Reported meter laggy, fader overshoot, status not working
- 19:16 UTC: Fader ok, meter still not fluent, status still brown
- 19:30 UTC: "Still not happy with meter and status"

## State Saved: 2025-07-04 19:30 UTC
**Status**: Fader fixed, logging fixed, meter and status still problematic
**Branch**: feature/performance-optimization  
**Next Action**: Need deeper investigation or consider reverting meter
**Critical**: User not satisfied with current meter performance
