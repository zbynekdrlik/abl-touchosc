# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Double-click mute feature COMPLETE
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing and feedback
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Implementation Status
- Phase: FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
- Step: Ready for user testing
- Status: AWAITING TEST RESULTS
- Branch: feature/double-click-mute
- PR: #24 (open) - https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/abl-touchosc/pull/24

## Feature Summary
**Double-click mute protection implemented successfully:**
- ✅ mute_button.lua v2.2.0 - Added double-click detection (500ms threshold)
- ✅ document_script.lua v2.9.0 - Updated documentation only
- ✅ README.md - Clarified configuration format (each group needs own line)
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md - Added feature entry
- ✅ PR #24 created and ready for review

## Configuration Format (FINAL)
```yaml
# IMPORTANT: Each group needs its own line!

# Instance-specific (one group per line)
double_click_mute_band: 'Band Tracks'
double_click_mute_band: 'Lead Vocals'
double_click_mute_band: 'Drums'

# Global (applies to all instances)
double_click_mute: 'Master Bus'
double_click_mute: 'Critical'
```

## What User Needs to Do Next
1. **Pull the feature branch**: `git pull && git checkout feature/double-click-mute`
2. **Update TouchOSC template** with new scripts
3. **Add configuration** for groups needing double-click protection
4. **Test the feature**:
   - Single-click on non-configured groups (should work normally)
   - Double-click on configured groups (should require two clicks within 500ms)
   - Test with multiple instances
5. **Provide feedback** on PR #24

## Testing Checklist for User
- [ ] Single-click works on non-configured tracks
- [ ] Double-click required on configured tracks
- [ ] 500ms timing feels natural
- [ ] Configuration parsing works correctly
- [ ] No regression on existing functionality
- [ ] Multiple instances work independently

## Technical Details
- Double-click window: 500ms (configurable in code if needed)
- Configuration read directly by mute_button.lua
- Backward compatible - no changes needed for existing setups
- Each mute button tracks its own click timing
- Visual feedback unchanged (button state shows mute status)

## Recent Changes (This Thread)
1. Implemented double-click detection in mute_button.lua
2. Updated documentation to clarify configuration format
3. Added comprehensive examples for multi-instance setups
4. Clarified that each group needs its own configuration line

## Next Thread Should:
- Review test results from user
- Fix any issues found during testing
- Consider adjusting timing threshold if needed
- Merge PR if tests pass
- Update version to v1.4.0 after merge
