## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ MUTE BUTTON MISSING OSC RECEIVE PATTERNS IN TEMPLATE**
- [x] Currently working on: Found root cause - mute button has NO OSC receive patterns
- [ ] Waiting for: User to add OSC patterns in TouchOSC Editor  
- [ ] Blocked by: Template file configuration issue

## Current Status (2025-07-04 14:00 UTC)

### ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED:
**The mute button controls have NO OSC receive patterns configured in the TouchOSC template file.** This is why they can send TO Ableton but never receive FROM Ableton.

### REQUIRED FIX:
In TouchOSC Editor, for EACH mute button control:
1. Select the mute button control
2. Go to OSC tab
3. Add receive patterns:
   - `/live/track/get/mute` (for regular tracks)
   - `/live/return/get/mute` (for return tracks)
4. Save and reload template

### WHAT THIS MEANS:
- The script code is actually CORRECT (v2.0.2)
- The issue is in the TouchOSC template configuration
- This CANNOT be fixed via script changes
- Must edit the .tosc file in TouchOSC Editor

### WORKING FEATURES:
- ✅ Fader movement (no jumping back)
- ✅ Pan control (including double-tap)
- ✅ Group discovery and track mapping
- ✅ Activity fade in/out
- ✅ Meter display (correct levels)
- ✅ DB meter label (showing dBFS)
- ✅ DB label (showing fader dB)

### NOT WORKING:
- ❌ **Mute button sync from Ableton** - Missing OSC receive patterns in template

## Current Script Versions

| Script | Version | Status | Issue |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|
| document_script.lua | v2.7.4 | ✅ Working | - |
| group_init.lua | v1.15.9 | ✅ Working | - |
| fader_script.lua | v2.6.0 | ✅ Fixed | - |
| meter_script.lua | v2.5.6 | ✅ Fixed | - |
| pan_control.lua | v1.4.2 | ✅ Working | - |
| db_label.lua | v1.3.2 | ✅ Fixed | - |
| db_meter_label.lua | v2.6.1 | ✅ Fixed | - |
| mute_button.lua | v2.0.2 | ⚠️ Script OK | Template missing OSC patterns |
| global_refresh_button.lua | v1.5.1 | ✅ Working | - |

## Template Configuration Issue

### To Verify:
1. Open the .tosc template in TouchOSC Editor
2. Select any mute button control
3. Check the OSC tab
4. Receive patterns will be EMPTY

### To Fix:
1. For each mute button in regular tracks:
   - Add receive pattern: `/live/track/get/mute`
2. For each mute button in return tracks:
   - Add receive pattern: `/live/return/get/mute`
3. Save template
4. Reload in TouchOSC

### Why This Happened:
- During template creation, OSC patterns were added for faders, meters, etc.
- Mute buttons were missed - they only have SEND patterns, not RECEIVE
- Without receive patterns, `onReceiveOSC` is never called

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate User Action:
1. **Open TouchOSC Editor**
2. **Add OSC receive patterns to ALL mute buttons**
3. **Save and test**

### After Template Fix:
- Test mute sync from Ableton
- Verify all controls work properly
- Set DEBUG = 0 in all scripts
- Commit and consider merge to main

## Testing Checklist After Template Fix
- [ ] Mute buttons sync when changed in Ableton
- [ ] Mute buttons still work when clicked in TouchOSC
- [ ] All other controls still working
- [ ] No console errors
