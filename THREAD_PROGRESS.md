## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**✅ ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Notify Usage Verified**
- [x] Currently working on: Notify usage analysis - COMPLETE
- [x] High-frequency usage check - COMPLETE (none found)
- [ ] Waiting for: User review of updated report
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Current Task: Notify Usage Analysis
**Started**: 2025-07-04
**Branch**: feature/notify-usage-analysis  
**Status**: ANALYSIS_COMPLETE
**PR**: #12 created

### Completed:
1. ✅ Analyzed all scripts for notify() usage
2. ✅ Created comprehensive report on current usage
3. ✅ Documented why notify is still needed
4. ✅ Provided alternative approaches
5. ✅ Made recommendations
6. ✅ **Verified NO high-frequency notify calls**

### Key Findings:
- **Notify is NO LONGER used for logging** (removed in v2.8.1)
- **Notify IS used for inter-script communication:**
  - Configuration registration (once at startup)
  - Global refresh coordination (user-triggered)
  - Parent-child track mapping updates (during refresh only)
  - Event broadcasting (infrequent)
- **NO HIGH-FREQUENCY USAGE FOUND:**
  - ✅ No notify in update() loops
  - ✅ No notify in frequent OSC handlers (volume/meter/mute/pan)
  - ✅ No notify in onValueChanged for frequent events
  - ✅ Only triggered by user actions (refresh button)

### Performance Impact:
- **Startup:** 1-2 notify calls
- **User Refresh:** ~40 calls for 8-track setup
- **Normal Operation:** 0 calls
- **During Performance:** 0 calls

### Report Location:
- `/docs/notify-usage-analysis.md` (updated with frequency analysis)

## Previous Task: Remove Centralized Logging (COMPLETE)
**Completed**: 2025-07-04
**Branch**: feature/remove-centralized-logging (merged)
**PR**: #11 - Merged

### Summary:
- Removed all centralized logging via notify()
- Each script now has local log() function with DEBUG=0
- All functionality preserved
- Production ready

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Code Analysis & Documentation
- Step: Notify usage analysis complete with frequency verification
- Status: ANALYSIS_COMPLETE

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Notify Analysis | ✅ | All scripts analyzed |
| Frequency Check | ✅ | No high-frequency usage found |
| Report Generation | ✅ | Comprehensive report created |
| Alternatives Documented | ✅ | 4 alternatives provided |
| Recommendations | ✅ | Keep notify for inter-script comm |

## Next Steps:
1. User reviews updated notify usage report
2. Merge documentation PR #12
3. No code changes needed - current implementation is optimal

## Recommendation:
**Keep notify() for inter-script communication** - it's working well, uses TouchOSC's intended mechanism, maintains clean architecture with loose coupling, and has NO performance impact since it's never used in high-frequency scenarios.
