# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ PR #28 IN PROGRESS:**
- [ ] Currently working on: Fix Android tablet refresh timing issue with simple 2s delay
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing on Android tablet with 200 tracks
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## ACTIVE WORK: ANDROID TABLET REFRESH TIMING FIX
### Problem Identified:
- On slower Android tablets with 200 tracks, faders sometimes not mapped during refresh
- Track name responses arrive before groups process refresh notification
- Previous complex solutions didn't work

### Solution Implemented:
1. **Simple 2-second delay**: ✅
   - Clear mappings → Wait 100ms → Notify groups → Wait 2s → Query track names
   - Groups have 2 full seconds to prepare before track names are queried
   - Status shows "Preparing (2s)..." during wait

2. **Updated Scripts**: ✅
   - `document_script.lua` v2.13.0 - Simple timing approach

3. **Testing Required**: ❌
   - [ ] Test on Windows TouchOSC (should work normally)
   - [ ] Test on slower Android tablet with 200 tracks
   - [ ] Verify all faders map correctly on both platforms

## COMPLETED WORK: PR #26 MERGED
### Duplicate Track Names Fix: COMPLETE
- [x] Centralized track names retrieval MERGED
- [x] Prevents duplicate OSC calls during refresh
- [x] Version 2.10.0 released

## COMPLETED WORK: DOUBLE-CLICK MUTE (PR #24)
### Final Status: READY FOR MERGE
- [x] Double-click mute protection COMPLETE AND WORKING
- [x] Documentation cleanup COMPLETE
- [x] Experimental files removed
- [x] README fully documented with two-control approach
- [x] CHANGELOG finalized for v1.5.0
- [x] Ready for merge
