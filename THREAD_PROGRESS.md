# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚úÖ READY TO MERGE - Documentation Complete**
- [x] Return track feature: COMPLETE AND WORKING
- [ ] Label display test: Need to verify A-, B- prefix removal (should work)
- [x] Performance issues: DOCUMENTED for future branch

## Current Status (2025-07-03 20:52)

### Return Track Feature
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Version**: 1.2.0
- **Testing**: All features working
- **Ready**: YES - pending label display verification

### Performance Optimization
- **Status**: üìÑ DOCUMENTED
- **Action**: Will be addressed in separate branch
- **Docs Created**:
  - `performance-optimization-phases.md` - Full implementation plan
  - `performance-issues-quick-reference.md` - Quick fixes guide

## Next Steps:

### 1. Test Label Display ‚è≥
Quick test before merge:
- Create return track "A-Reverb" ‚Üí verify shows "Reverb"
- Create return track "B-Delay" ‚Üí verify shows "Delay"
- Code review indicates this should work (group_init.lua lines 193-210)

### 2. Merge PR #8 ‚úÖ
- Return track feature complete
- Documentation complete
- Performance issues documented for next branch
- Ready for v1.2.0 release

### 3. Future Work üöÄ
Create `feature/performance-optimization` branch with:
- Phase 1: Quick wins (scheduled updates, debug fixes)
- Phase 2: Smart updates (event-driven, batching)
- Phase 3: Architecture optimization
- Phase 4: Advanced optimizations

## Implementation Status - RETURN TRACKS
- Phase: COMPLETE - READY FOR MERGE
- Status: ‚úÖ All features implemented and tested
- Version: 1.2.0

## Branch Status

- Implementation: ‚úÖ Complete
- Documentation: ‚úÖ Complete (including performance docs)
- Cleanup: ‚úÖ Complete
- Testing: ‚úÖ Complete (except label verification)
- **Ready for merge: YES**

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Merge return tracks first** - Feature is complete and working
2. **Optimize separately** - Performance affects all tracks, not just returns
3. **Document thoroughly** - Created phase docs for optimization work

## Performance Documentation Created

### 1. performance-optimization-phases.md
- 4 phases of optimization
- Specific tasks and code examples
- Expected impact measurements
- Timeline: 8-12 days total

### 2. performance-issues-quick-reference.md  
- Critical issues identified
- Quick fix examples
- Priority order
- Testing commands

## Summary

The return track feature (v1.2.0) is complete and ready to merge. Performance issues have been thoroughly documented for future optimization work. Once label display is verified, the PR can be merged and tagged for release.
