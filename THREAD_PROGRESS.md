# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: dB meter label display based on audio output
- [x] Created new feature branch: feature/db-meter
- [x] Created db_meter_label.lua script v2.2.1 with enhanced low-value logging
- [x] Added calibration rule documentation
- [x] Fixed all calibration and range issues
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test low values below -22 dBFS with v2.2.1
- [ ] Issue: User reports meter visually moves but no logs appear below -22 dBFS

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Feature Development - dB Meter Display
- Step: Debugging low value logging with v2.2.1
- Status: TESTING/DEBUGGING

## Feature: Add dBFS Meter Display Based on Track Output
Creating a proper peak dBFS meter that shows actual audio level from track output meter.

### Current Solution (v2.2.1)
- Calibration table method with extended range
- Based on verified reference points:
  - OSC meter 0.631 = -22 dBFS ✓
  - OSC meter 0.842 = -6 dBFS ✓
- Full range from -∞ to +60 dBFS
- **v2.2.1 Enhancement**: Always logs values below -22 dBFS for debugging

### Issues Fixed
1. **v1.x**: Incorrect calibration using fader math
2. **v2.0.0**: Single-point calibration didn't work across range
3. **v2.1.0**: Missing calibration points below -22 dBFS
4. **v2.2.0**: FIXED - Extended calibration table for full range
5. **v2.2.1**: Enhanced logging to debug low values not appearing in logs

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| db_meter_label.lua | ✅ v2.2.1 | ⏳ Testing | ❌ | ❌ |
| Calibration rule | ✅ | - | - | - |

## Script Versions - Feature Branch
| Script | Version | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| db_meter_label.lua | 2.2.1 | ⏳ Testing low value logging |

### Version History
- v1.0.0: Initial implementation (incorrect calibration)
- v1.0.1: Updated to use proper "dBFS" unit notation
- v1.1.0: Extended to handle floating-point headroom
- v1.1.1: Fixed timeout issue causing premature -∞ display
- v2.0.0: Complete rewrite with calibration (single point)
- v2.1.0: Calibration table method (missing low values)
- v2.2.0: Extended calibration table for full range
- **v2.2.1: Enhanced logging for values below -22 dBFS**

## Current Issue
User reports:
- Meter visually moves to lower positions
- Values correctly show down to -22.3 dBFS
- No logs appear for values below -22 dBFS

### v2.2.1 Changes
- Added `lastMeterValue` tracking
- Always logs values below -22 dBFS (unless -∞)
- Logs when meter value changes by > 0.01 for values below -20 dB
- Should catch gradual fades that 1.0 dB threshold was missing

## TouchOSC Integration Steps
User needs to:
1. Open TouchOSC editor
2. Add a new Label control to each track group
3. Name it exactly: `db_meter_label`
4. Position it near the existing meter
5. Attach the `db_meter_label.lua` script to it
6. Set OSC receive pattern: `/live/track/get/output_meter_level`
7. Size label to fit text like "-12.5 dBFS" (10-11 characters)
8. Test with actual audio playback

## Technical Implementation
- Calibration table with verified points and extended range
- Linear interpolation between calibration points
- Special handling for near-zero values (logarithmic)
- No buffering or update threshold - instant updates
- Full range: -∞ to +60 dBFS

## Documentation Created
- `rules/abletonosc-meter-calibration.md` - Calibration method documentation
- Documented why previous attempts failed
- Preserved verified calibration points for future reference

## Next Steps
1. User tests the v2.2.1 script with enhanced logging
2. Check if logs now appear for values below -22 dBFS
3. Verify meter values are being sent by AbletonOSC for very low signals
4. If still no logs, may need to check if AbletonOSC stops sending updates below certain threshold
5. Consider adding DEBUG mode for even more verbose logging
