# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Connection verified working (Connection 1)
- [x] Regular tracks work correctly (0-8 for 9 tracks)
- [ ] **CRITICAL ISSUE**: AbletonOSC does NOT expose return tracks!
- [ ] Next: Investigate AbletonOSC source code to understand why

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY - RETURN TRACKS NOT ACCESSIBLE
**Test Results:**
- `/live/song/get/num_tracks` returns 9 (only regular tracks)
- `/live/song/get/num_return_tracks` - DOES NOT EXIST
- Track indices 0-8 control the 9 regular tracks ✅
- Track index 9+ gives "Index out of range" ❌
- Return Track A exists in Ableton but is NOT accessible via OSC

## The Core Problem
Despite AbletonOSC documentation claiming it supports "audio, MIDI, return or master track", our testing shows:
1. Only regular tracks are counted in `num_tracks`
2. Return tracks are not accessible via extended indexing
3. No dedicated return track API exists

## Implementation Status
- Phase: 1 - Core Implementation
- Step: BLOCKED - AbletonOSC limitation discovered
- Status: Need to investigate AbletonOSC source code

## Next Actions
1. **Search AbletonOSC public repository**
2. **Find why return tracks aren't exposed**
3. **Determine if this is a bug or missing feature**
4. **Look for workarounds or alternative approaches**

## Test Scripts Status
All test scripts confirmed the issue - AbletonOSC doesn't expose return tracks as expected.

## Key Learning
Our initial assumption based on API documentation was wrong. The track API description mentions return tracks, but they're not actually accessible through the standard track indexing system.
