# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: IDENTIFIED ROOT CAUSE - Architectural mistake with notify()
- [x] Waiting for: Deep analysis of OSC handling in all scripts - COMPLETED
- [x] Blocked by: Need to revert to direct OSC handling everywhere - FIXES IMPLEMENTED
- [ ] **NEW CRITICAL ISSUE**: Still using notify() for things that should be direct!

## Current Status (2025-07-04 20:20 UTC)

### üö® NEW PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: NOTIFY STILL BEING MISUSED

**CONTRADICTIONS FOUND:**
1. **log_message notify** - Still exists despite agreeing each script handles its own logs!
2. **value_changed in db_meter_label** - Why is there a "fallback"? User never asked for fallback!
3. **Multiple other notify uses** - Need systematic review

### ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLES (BEING VIOLATED):
1. **Each script handles its own logging** - NO log_message notify!
2. **Each control receives data directly** - NO value_changed chains!
3. **Notify should be minimal** - Only for critical state changes

### GOAL: SYSTEMATIC NOTIFY REVIEW

**Review each notify usage and determine:**
- [ ] Is this notify actually needed?
- [ ] Can it be replaced with direct handling?
- [ ] Does it create any chains or dependencies?

### NOTIFY INSTANCES TO REVIEW:

1. **log_message** - REMOVE COMPLETELY
   - Each script prints its own logs
   - No centralized logging via notify

2. **value_changed in db_meter_label** - REMOVE
   - No "fallback" was requested
   - Should only receive OSC directly

3. **track_changed** - REVIEW
   - Is this needed or can children read parent tag directly?

4. **track_type** - REVIEW
   - Same question as track_changed

5. **track_unmapped** - REVIEW
   - What action do children actually take?

6. **child_touched/released** - REVIEW
   - Are these creating chains?
   - What uses sibling_touched/released?

7. **sibling_value_changed** - REVIEW
   - Only db_label uses for fader - is this needed?

8. **refresh_all_groups** - PROBABLY OK
   - One-time trigger for discovery

### NEXT STEPS:
1. Remove log_message completely from all scripts
2. Remove value_changed fallback from db_meter_label
3. Review each remaining notify one by one
4. Document why each kept notify is essential
