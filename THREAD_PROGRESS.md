# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: dB meter label display based on audio output
- [x] Created new feature branch: feature/db-meter
- [x] Created db_meter_label.lua script v1.0.0
- [x] Updated to v1.0.1 with proper dBFS unit notation
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test the new dB meter script in TouchOSC
- [ ] Blocked by: Need user to add dB meter label control to TouchOSC interface

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Feature Development - dB Meter Display
- Step: Script created and ready for testing
- Status: IMPLEMENTING

## Feature: Add dBFS Meter Display Based on Track Output
Creating a proper peak dBFS meter that shows actual audio level from track output meter.

### Background
- Previous LUFS implementation was fundamentally flawed
- LUFS cannot be calculated from simple peak meter values
- LUFS requires frequency weighting, time integration, and complex algorithms
- AbletonOSC output_meter_level provides normalized peak values (0.0-1.0)

### Requirements
- Display peak dBFS value based on actual audio output level
- Update in real-time with audio meter
- Show appropriate dBFS range (typically -∞ to +6 dBFS)
- Use exact same calibration as meter script for accuracy
- Integrate with existing multi-connection routing
- Display format: "-12.5 dBFS" or "-∞ dBFS" for silence

### Implementation Details
The script:
- Listens to `/live/track/get/output_meter_level` (same as meter)
- Uses EXACT calibration points from meter_script.lua
- Converts normalized values → fader position → audio value → dBFS
- Displays with proper formatting:
  - "-∞ dBFS" for silence or very low levels
  - "±X.X dBFS" for normal levels (e.g., "-12.5 dBFS", "+3.2 dBFS")
  - Shows "+" for positive dBFS values
- Updates only when change > 0.1 dB to reduce flicker
- Shows "-∞ dBFS" if no data received for 2 seconds

### Key Differences from LUFS Attempt
- Based on actual peak levels, not perceptual loudness
- Direct mathematical conversion, no arbitrary offsets
- Accurate representation of what the meter shows
- No false averaging or time integration
- Proper unit notation: dBFS (decibels relative to Full Scale)

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| db_meter_label.lua | ✅ v1.0.1 | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-02
- Action: Asked about proper unit notation for dB peak
- Result: Updated script to use dBFS (decibels relative to Full Scale)
- Next Required: Add dB meter label to TouchOSC interface

## Script Versions - Feature Branch
| Script | Version | Status |
|--------|---------|---------|
| db_meter_label.lua | 1.0.1 | ✅ Updated with dBFS unit notation |

## TouchOSC Integration Steps Required
User needs to:
1. Open TouchOSC editor
2. Add a new Label control to each track group
3. Name it exactly: `db_meter_label`
4. Position it near the existing meter
5. Attach the `db_meter_label.lua` script to it
6. Set OSC receive pattern: `/live/track/get/output_meter_level`
7. Size label to fit text like "-12.5 dBFS" (10-11 characters)
8. Test with actual audio playback

## Configuration
- No configuration changes required
- dBFS meter label uses same connection routing as meter
- Works with existing track mapping system

## Technical Notes
- Uses exact calibration from meter_script.lua for accuracy
- Conversion chain: OSC value → fader position → audio value → dBFS
- Same mathematical functions as fader for consistency
- Peak meter values, not RMS or integrated loudness
- dBFS = decibels relative to Full Scale (0 dBFS = maximum digital level)

## Next Steps
1. User adds dB meter label control to TouchOSC
2. Test dBFS display with audio playback
3. Verify dBFS values match expected levels
4. Compare with Ableton's built-in meter readings
5. Fine-tune update threshold if needed
6. Update documentation
