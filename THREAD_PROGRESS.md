# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ MULTI-CONNECTION REGRESSION FIXED WITH PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:**
- [x] Issue identified: Meter scripts lost multi-connection support after v1.2.0
- [x] Root cause: getConnectionIndex() function and connection filtering removed
- [x] Performance issue found: Connection lookup happening 30+ times per second
- [x] Fixed: meter_script.lua v2.5.1 (with caching)
- [x] Fixed: db_meter_label.lua v2.7.1 (with caching)
- [x] Fixed: db_label.lua v1.4.1 (with caching)
- [x] PR #20 created and ready for review
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing and merge approval

## Implementation Status
- Phase: CRITICAL BUG FIX + PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
- Status: COMPLETE - Ready for testing
- Branch: feature/restore-multi-connection-meter

## What Happened
After the v1.2.0 release (which added return track support), subsequent updates to meter scripts accidentally removed the multi-connection functionality. This caused all meters to respond to ALL Ableton instances instead of filtering by their assigned connection.

## Performance Issue Found and Fixed
When restoring multi-connection support, discovered that getConnectionIndex() was being called on EVERY meter update (30+ times per second), causing:
- Configuration file reading/parsing 30+ times per second
- String matching operations on every update
- Significant CPU usage with multiple meters

**Solution**: Implemented connection index caching
- Connection is determined once at init
- Cached value used for all subsequent checks
- Cache cleared when track changes or unmapped

## Scripts Affected and Fixed
| Script | Old Version | Fixed Version | Changes |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| meter_script.lua | 2.4.1 | 2.5.1 | Restored connection support + caching |
| db_meter_label.lua | 2.6.1 | 2.7.1 | Restored connection support + caching |
| db_label.lua | 1.3.1 | 1.4.1 | Restored connection support + caching |

Additional optimizations:
- Only update displays when values change significantly
- Reduced debug logging frequency
- Improved overall performance

## Scripts NOT Affected
These scripts maintained their multi-connection support:
- fader_script.lua ✅ (already optimized)
- pan_control.lua ✅  
- mute_button.lua ✅
- group_init.lua ✅

## Technical Details
The regression occurred because:
1. Multi-connection support was added AFTER v1.2.0
2. When meter scripts were updated for other features, the old versions were used as base
3. The getConnectionIndex() function and connection filtering logic were not preserved

## Testing Required
Users with multiple Ableton instances should test:
1. Meters only respond to their assigned connection
2. Animation features still work correctly
3. Debug mode toggle (db_meter_label) still works
4. Performance is good even with many meters
5. Connection caching works properly

## Next Steps
1. User tests the fix with multiple Ableton instances
2. Verify meters are properly isolated by connection
3. Verify performance improvement
4. Merge PR #20 if testing successful
5. Consider adding automated tests to prevent similar regressions

## Lesson Learned
When updating scripts:
1. Always check for features added after the last major release
2. Consider performance impact of repeated operations
3. Use caching for expensive lookups that don't change frequently
4. The multi-connection support was a critical feature that should never have been lost
