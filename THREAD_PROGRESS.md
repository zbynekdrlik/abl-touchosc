## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: Fix refresh all button track renumbering issue
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing of the NEW approach in v2.8.7
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Current Task: Fix Refresh Track Renumbering
**Started**: 2025-07-05
**Branch**: feature/fix-refresh-track-renumbering  
**Status**: NEW_APPROACH_IMPLEMENTED
**PR**: #15 - Updated with registration approach

### Problem Evolution:
1. Initial problem: When inserting a new track at the beginning in Ableton, tracks get renumbered but refresh doesn't update mappings
2. First bug: After mapping, refresh found 0 groups (tag changed from "trackGroup")
3. Second bug: Can't search TouchOSC control hierarchy (children is userdata, not table)

### NEW Solution - Registration Approach:
1. ✅ Updated group_init.lua v1.16.2:
   - Each group now registers itself with document script on init
   - Still handles clear_mapping and refresh_tracks properly
   - Maintains all previous functionality

2. ✅ Updated document_script.lua v2.8.7:
   - Maintains a table of registered track groups
   - No more searching - groups register themselves
   - Clear and refresh operations use the registered groups
   - Works regardless of tag changes

3. ✅ Previous fixes still in place:
   - group_init.lua: Resets tag on clear_mapping, notifies children
   - fader_script.lua v2.5.3: Handles mapping_cleared notification
   - 100ms delay between clear and refresh phases

### Testing Instructions:
1. Open Ableton with multiple tracks (e.g., 4-8 tracks)
2. Load the updated TouchOSC template
3. Verify console shows groups registering: "Registered track group: master_A-Repro LR #" etc.
4. Map tracks and verify faders control correct tracks
5. Press "Refresh All" to ensure it finds groups (should say "Cleared 2 groups", NOT 0)
6. Insert a new track at the beginning in Ableton
7. Press "Refresh All" button in TouchOSC again
8. Verify that:
   - Console shows "Cleared 2 groups" (or appropriate number, NOT 0)
   - Status shows "Clearing..." → "Waiting..." → "Refreshing..." → "Ready"
   - All faders now control the correct renumbered tracks
   - No faders control the wrong track

### Changes Made:
- **group_init.lua v1.16.2**: Added self-registration with document script
- **document_script.lua v2.8.7**: Switched from searching to registration approach
- **fader_script.lua v2.5.3**: (unchanged) Handles mapping_cleared notification

## Previous Attempts:
1. v2.8.3: Added delay between clear/refresh
2. v2.8.4: Tried to find groups by name pattern (failed - findAllByProperty doesn't work as expected)
3. v2.8.5: Tried recursive search (failed - children is userdata)
4. v2.8.6: Added debug logging (revealed the userdata issue)
5. v2.8.7: NEW APPROACH - Registration system

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Bug Fixes & Improvements
- Step: Track renumbering refresh fix with registration approach
- Status: CODE_COMPLETE

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| group_init.lua v1.16.2 | ✅ | Self-registers with document |
| fader_script.lua v2.5.3 | ✅ | Handles mapping_cleared |
| document_script.lua v2.8.7 | ✅ | Registration-based approach |
| Integration Testing | ⏳ | Ready for user testing |

## Next Steps:
1. User tests the new registration approach
2. Verify groups register on startup
3. Verify refresh finds all groups
4. Verify track renumbering works correctly
5. Merge PR if successful
