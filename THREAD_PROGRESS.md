# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Phase document created: `docs/return-tracks-phases.md`
- [x] Source code analysis complete - return tracks use extended indexing
- [ ] Moving to Phase 1: Core Implementation
- [ ] Next: Update group_init.lua to discover return tracks

## Implementation Status
- Phase: 1 - Core Implementation
- Step: 1.1 - Track Discovery Extension
- Status: READY TO IMPLEMENT

## Feature: Add Send/Return Track Control
Enable control of Ableton's send/return tracks in addition to regular audio/MIDI tracks.

### Phase 0 Complete ✅
- [x] 0.1 Research & Documentation
- [x] 0.2 Test Script Development
- [x] 0.3 Source Code Analysis - CONFIRMED: Extended indexing approach

### Source Code Analysis Results
1. **AbletonOSC DOES support return tracks**
   - Track API explicitly mentions "audio, MIDI, return or master track"
   - APIs exist: `/live/song/create_return_track` and `/live/song/delete_return_track`
   
2. **Return tracks use extended indexing**
   - Same `/live/track/` commands as regular tracks
   - Indices continue after regular tracks
   - Example: 6 regular tracks (0-5), 2 returns (6-7), master (8)

3. **Identification methods**
   - Track names often contain "Return"
   - Missing certain properties (input_routing_channel)
   - Position in track list (after regular, before master)

### Phase 1 Starting
- [x] Confirmed implementation approach: Extended indexing
- [ ] 1.1 Modify group_init.lua for return track discovery
- [ ] 1.2 Implement track type detection system
- [ ] 1.3 Test basic control functionality

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Researched | Documented | Implementation | Tested | 
|-----------|------------|------------|----------------|--------|
| Return track analysis | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Access method | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Phase planning | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A |
| Source code analysis | ✅ | ✅ | N/A | N/A |
| TouchOSC integration | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Previous Task Completed
- [x] db_meter_label.lua v2.4.0 - Production ready
- [x] PR #7 merged to main
- [x] Feature complete - no more work needed

## Documentation Created
- `docs/return-tracks-analysis.md` - Initial research findings
- `docs/return-tracks-implementation-plan.md` - Technical implementation approach
- `docs/return-tracks-phases.md` - Comprehensive 7-phase implementation plan

## Scripts Created
- `return_track_test.py` - Discovery script (no longer needed)
- TouchOSC test functions - For manual testing if needed

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **Begin Phase 1.1 Implementation:**
   - Modify `group_init.lua` to continue track discovery beyond regular tracks
   - Add logic to identify return tracks by name/properties
   - Store track type in group metadata
   - Version: 2.0.0 (major functionality addition)

2. **Implementation approach:**
   - Query total track count with `/live/song/get/num_tracks`
   - Continue indexing beyond known regular tracks
   - Identify returns by name pattern or missing properties
   - Tag groups with track type for UI differentiation

## User Context
User wants to control send/return tracks in Ableton, not just regular tracks. Source code analysis confirms AbletonOSC supports this via extended indexing.

## Key Code Insights
- Return tracks are part of the standard track list
- No separate `/live/return/` namespace (unlike old LiveOSC)
- All track commands work on return tracks
- Track indices are continuous: regular → return → master

## Thread Handoff Notes
- Source analysis complete - no test script needed
- Ready to implement Phase 1
- Extended indexing confirmed as the approach
- All research indicates this will work as expected
