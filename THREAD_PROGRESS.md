# Thread Progress Tracking

## Current Status
- **Phase**: 3 - Script Functionality Testing
- **Step**: Ready to create single complete track group
- **Date**: 2025-06-28
- **Branch**: feature/selective-connection-routing

## Important Context
- Document script (v2.5.8) tested and working
- Configuration and logger objects working perfectly
- Notify system implemented and tested
- Global refresh button (v1.2.1) working with proper logging
- **Test track**: "band_CG #"
- **CLARIFIED**: Connection routing is AUTOMATIC based on group names!

## Critical Design Clarification
The entire selective connection routing system works automatically:
- **Group names determine connections** (band_* → connection 1, master_* → connection 2)
- **Scripts handle ALL filtering** - no need to set connections in UI
- **Enable all connections in OSC settings** - let the scripts do the work!
- This was the original design goal and it's already implemented correctly

## Phase 3 Progress

### Setup Phase
- ✅ Configuration text object (working)
- ✅ Logger text object (working - shows messages correctly)
- ✅ Document script attached to root (v2.5.8)
- ✅ Notify system tested (refresh_all_groups notification works)
- ✅ Global refresh button (v1.2.1) - Working with proper logging
- ✅ Single track complete test instructions created
- ✅ Updated test track to "band_CG #"
- ✅ Reviewed all track scripts for compliance
- ✅ Updated docs to clarify automatic routing
- [ ] Create ONE complete track group - READY TO TEST

### Script Review Results
All scripts follow TouchOSC rules and implement automatic routing:
- **group_init.lua** (v1.5.1): Parses name, filters by connection automatically
- **fader_script.lua** (v2.0.0): Gets connection from parent group
- **meter_script.lua** (v2.0.0): Filters incoming messages by connection
- **mute_button.lua** (v1.0.0): Routes to correct connection
- **pan_control.lua** (v1.0.0): Connection-aware sending

### Script Testing Phase (Single Group First)
- [ ] Create group "band_CG #" with all connections enabled
- [ ] Verify automatic connection 1 selection
- [ ] Test fader script in group
- [ ] Test meter script in group
- [ ] Test mute button in group
- [ ] Test pan control in group
- [ ] Test all controls working together

## Current Task: Create Complete "band_CG #" Group
User needs to create ONE complete track group with:
1. Group container named "band_CG #" (enables all connections in UI)
2. Status LED indicator
3. Track label
4. Fader with script
5. Meter display with script
6. Mute button with script
7. Pan control with script

The "band_" prefix will automatically route to connection 1!

## Script Versions Ready for Testing
- **document_script.lua**: v2.5.8
- **group_init.lua**: v1.5.1 (automatic connection routing)
- **global_refresh_button.lua**: v1.2.1
- **fader_script.lua**: v2.0.0
- **meter_script.lua**: v2.0.0
- **mute_button.lua**: v1.0.0
- **pan_control.lua**: v1.0.0

## Documentation Updates
- ✅ Updated single-track-complete-test.md
- ✅ Updated test-group-setup.md
- Both now correctly explain automatic connection routing

## Next Steps
1. User creates single complete band_CG # group (with all connections enabled)
2. Test automatic routing to connection 1
3. Test all controls working together
4. Once perfect, test master_* group for connection 2
5. Then scale to production layout
