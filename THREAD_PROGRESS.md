# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Currently working on: dB meter label display based on audio output
- [x] Created new feature branch: feature/db-meter
- [x] Created db_meter_label.lua script v2.2.0 with full range calibration
- [x] Added calibration rule documentation
- [x] Fixed all calibration and range issues
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test the final version
- [ ] Ready for: Merge after successful testing

## Implementation Status
- Phase: Feature Development - dB Meter Display
- Step: Script complete with full range calibration
- Status: READY FOR FINAL TESTING

## Feature: Add dBFS Meter Display Based on Track Output
Creating a proper peak dBFS meter that shows actual audio level from track output meter.

### Final Solution (v2.2.0)
- Calibration table method with extended range
- Based on verified reference points:
  - OSC meter 0.631 = -22 dBFS ✓
  - OSC meter 0.842 = -6 dBFS ✓
- Full range from -∞ to +60 dBFS
- Works correctly for all values including below -22 dBFS

### Issues Fixed
1. **v1.x**: Incorrect calibration using fader math
2. **v2.0.0**: Single-point calibration didn't work across range
3. **v2.1.0**: Missing calibration points below -22 dBFS
4. **v2.2.0**: FIXED - Extended calibration table for full range

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Multi-Instance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| db_meter_label.lua | ✅ v2.2.0 | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Calibration rule | ✅ | - | - | - |

## Script Versions - Feature Branch
| Script | Version | Status |
|--------|---------|---------|
| db_meter_label.lua | 2.2.0 | ✅ Full range calibration working |

### Version History
- v1.0.0: Initial implementation (incorrect calibration)
- v1.0.1: Updated to use proper "dBFS" unit notation
- v1.1.0: Extended to handle floating-point headroom
- v1.1.1: Fixed timeout issue causing premature -∞ display
- v2.0.0: Complete rewrite with calibration (single point)
- v2.1.0: Calibration table method (missing low values)
- **v2.2.0: Extended calibration table for full range**

## TouchOSC Integration Steps
User needs to:
1. Open TouchOSC editor
2. Add a new Label control to each track group
3. Name it exactly: `db_meter_label`
4. Position it near the existing meter
5. Attach the `db_meter_label.lua` script to it
6. Set OSC receive pattern: `/live/track/get/output_meter_level`
7. Size label to fit text like "-12.5 dBFS" (10-11 characters)
8. Test with actual audio playback

## Technical Implementation
- Calibration table with verified points and extended range
- Linear interpolation between calibration points
- Special handling for near-zero values (logarithmic)
- No buffering or update threshold - instant updates
- Full range: -∞ to +60 dBFS

## Documentation Created
- `rules/abletonosc-meter-calibration.md` - Calibration method documentation
- Documented why previous attempts failed
- Preserved verified calibration points for future reference

## Next Steps
1. User tests the v2.2.0 script
2. Verify values match Ableton across full range
3. Test low values (below -22 dBFS)
4. If successful, merge PR
5. Close old LUFS feature branch
