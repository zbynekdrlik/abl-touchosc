# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è FIXED - READY FOR TESTING AGAIN**
- [x] Fixed: Document script error (bad argument to ipairs)
- [x] Fixed: Groups now set initial tag = "trackGroup" for discovery
- [x] Fixed: Document script uses original findAllByProperty method
- [ ] Currently working on: Awaiting user test with fixed group discovery
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing to verify track mapping works
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## Current Status (2025-07-04 14:33 UTC)

### Critical Fixes Applied (Round 5)
1. **document_script.lua** (v2.7.3 ‚Üí v2.7.4)
   - **Fixed**: Runtime error "bad argument #1 to 'ipairs' (table expected, got userdata)"
   - Removed custom findGroups() function that caused errors
   - Restored original findAllByProperty("tag", "trackGroup", true) method
   - Result: No more runtime errors

2. **group_init.lua** (v1.15.7 ‚Üí v1.15.8)
   - **CRITICAL**: Added `self.tag = "trackGroup"` in init()
   - This allows document script to find groups
   - Groups still update tag later with track info
   - Result: Groups are now discoverable

### Error Analysis
The issue was:
- Groups weren't setting initial tag = "trackGroup"
- Document script couldn't find any groups (0 groups)
- My attempt to fix with custom function caused ipairs error
- Solution: Restore original implementation from main branch

### Previous Fixes (Still Active)
All fixes from Rounds 1-4 remain in place:
- Track discovery mechanism restored
- Property errors fixed (value ‚Üí x, enabled ‚Üí interactive)
- Schedule() replaced with time-based checks
- Fader position checks removed
- Event-driven meter updates
- DEBUG = 1 enabled for troubleshooting

## Implementation Status - PERFORMANCE
- Phase: 1 of 4 - Quick Wins + Critical Fix + Complete Script Coverage
- Step: FIXED group discovery - awaiting test
- Status: READY FOR USER TESTING

## Testing Status Matrix - FIXED
| Component | Version | Status | Key Fix |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| document_script | v2.7.4 | ‚úÖ Fixed | Uses correct findAllByProperty |
| group_init | v1.15.8 | ‚úÖ Fixed | Sets tag = "trackGroup" |
| fader_script | v2.5.6 | ‚úÖ Ready | DEBUG enabled |
| meter_script | v2.5.3 | ‚úÖ Ready | DEBUG enabled |
| pan_control | v1.4.2 | ‚úÖ Ready | Position stability |
| db_label | v1.3.0 | ‚úÖ Ready | Logger removed |
| db_meter_label | v2.6.0 | ‚úÖ Ready | No empty update() |
| mute_button | v2.0.0 | ‚úÖ Ready | Logger removed |
| global_refresh_button | v1.5.1 | ‚úÖ Ready | Time-based reset |

## User's Last Test Results
From logs at 14:24:48:
- Document script loaded correctly (v2.7.3)
- Group loaded with correct configuration
- Runtime error occurred: "bad argument #1 to 'ipairs'"
- 0 groups were found for refresh
- This has been FIXED in v2.7.4

## Expected Debug Output (FIXED)

### On Startup:
```
Document Script v2.7.4
[DEBUG]: Found 1 groups with tag 'trackGroup'
=== AUTOMATIC STARTUP REFRESH ===
[DEBUG]: Refreshing group: master_A-Repro LR #
GROUP(master_A-Repro LR #): Refreshing track mapping
```

### Track Discovery:
```
GROUP(master_A-Repro LR #): Received track names, checking for: A-Repro LR #
GROUP(master_A-Repro LR #): Track 0: [actual track name]
GROUP(master_A-Repro LR #): Mapped to Regular Track X
```

## Next Steps

### 1. User Testing Required üéØ
1. **Update these scripts**:
   - document_script.lua (v2.7.4)
   - group_init.lua (v1.15.8)
   - fader_script.lua (v2.5.6) - user still has v2.5.5
2. **Restart TouchOSC**
3. **Connect to Ableton Live**
4. **Verify**:
   - No runtime errors
   - Groups are found (not 0 groups)
   - Track discovery works
   - Controls become enabled

### 2. Expected Working Flow:
1. Group sets tag = "trackGroup" on init
2. Document script finds group with this tag
3. Refresh triggers track discovery
4. Group finds its track and updates tag
5. Controls become enabled
6. Faders/meters start working

### 3. If Working:
- Performance should be significantly improved
- Ready to set DEBUG = 0 and merge

## Technical Solution Summary

### Problem:
- Groups didn't have initial tag for discovery
- Custom findGroups() function incompatible with TouchOSC

### Solution:
- Restored original tag-based discovery
- Groups set tag = "trackGroup" initially
- Document script uses findAllByProperty (TouchOSC native)

### Key Learning:
- Must follow TouchOSC Lua rules strictly
- Can't use ipairs on control collections
- Initial tag required for discovery pattern

## All Script Versions Summary

### Core Scripts (Updated):
- document_script.lua: v2.7.4 (fixed group finding)
- group_init.lua: v1.15.8 (added initial tag)
- fader_script.lua: v2.5.6 (DEBUG enabled)
- meter_script.lua: v2.5.3 (DEBUG enabled)

### Other Optimized Scripts:
- pan_control.lua: v1.4.2
- db_label.lua: v1.3.0
- db_meter_label.lua: v2.6.0
- mute_button.lua: v2.0.0
- global_refresh_button.lua: v1.5.1

## Performance Optimization Summary

### Achieved:
- Removed all continuous update() loops where possible
- Event-driven meter updates (zero CPU when no data)
- Time-based sync instead of schedule()
- Logger system completely removed
- All scripts optimized

### Expected Gains:
- CPU Usage: 70-85% reduction
- Response Time: < 100ms
- Frame Rate: Consistent 30+ FPS
- Track Capacity: Smooth with 32+ tracks

## Branch Status

- Implementation: ‚úÖ Complete
- Bug fixes: ‚úÖ Complete (5 rounds)
- Documentation: ‚úÖ Updated
- Testing: ‚ùå Awaiting test with fixes
- **Ready for merge: Almost** (needs working test)

## Session Summary
- Started with performance optimization request
- Fixed 5 rounds of bugs and errors
- Currently all scripts updated and ready
- Waiting for user to test final fixes
- Once confirmed working, can disable DEBUG and merge
