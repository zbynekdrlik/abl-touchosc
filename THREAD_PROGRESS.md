## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FADER BUG FIXED - v2.6.2**
- [x] Currently working on: Fixed critical fader initialization bug
- [ ] Waiting for: User to test if fader now works properly
- [ ] Blocked by: Need to verify fader fix before addressing other issues

## Current Status (2025-07-04 14:58 UTC)

### CRITICAL BUG FOUND AND FIXED:
- **Fader Script v2.6.2** - Critical initialization bug fixed:
  - **PROBLEM**: Script was setting `self.values.x = 0.0` in init()
  - **EFFECT**: This caused fader to send 0 position to Ableton on startup
  - **SOLUTION**: Removed position setting - preserve existing fader position
  - **KEY INSIGHT**: Main branch NEVER sets initial position in init()

### Previous Fix (v2.6.1):
- Fixed `onValueChanged()` signature (TouchOSC doesn't support parameters)
- Removed send control complexity that was breaking volume
- Restored all movement scaling from main branch
- Kept performance optimizations (event-driven, no continuous polling)

### STILL BROKEN (awaiting test results):
- **Status indicator** - Not working at all (need to identify which script)
- **Meter** - Unclear behavior (need more details)

### CONFIRMED WORKING:
- **Mute button** (v2.0.3) - Working correctly
- **Pan control** (v1.4.2) - Working correctly  
- **DB label** (v1.3.2) - OK
- **DB meter label** (v2.6.1) - OK

## Critical Fader Bug Analysis

### Root Cause:
The optimization branch added `self.values.x = 0.0` in init() which caused:
1. Fader initializes with position = 0
2. Track gets mapped
3. Fader immediately sends position 0 to Ableton
4. Ableton responds with actual position (49.6%)
5. Fader jumps to correct position

### Why Main Branch Works:
- NEVER sets initial position in init()
- Preserves whatever position the fader already has
- Only requests position FROM Ableton, never sends on startup

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Fader Fix (Critical)
Please test the fader now:
- Should NOT move on startup
- Should sync with Ableton's current position
- Should respond properly to touch
- Should work with all movement scaling

### 2. Identify Status Indicator
Need to find which script controls the status indicator:
- Check template for object name
- Could be part of group_init.lua
- Might be a separate script

### 3. Clarify Meter Issues
What exactly is wrong with the meter?
- Visual display issues?
- Value accuracy problems?
- Color changes not working?

## Testing Needed

Please reload the template and test:
```
1. Fader should NOT move on startup
2. Check console for version: "FADER Script v2.6.2 loaded"
3. Test fader movement and response
4. Note any error messages
```

## State Saved: 2025-07-04 14:58 UTC
**Status**: Critical fader initialization bug fixed with v2.6.2
**Next Action**: Test that fader doesn't move on startup
**Key Fix**: Never set initial position - preserve existing state
