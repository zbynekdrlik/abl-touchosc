# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Created test scripts for return track discovery
- [ ] Currently debugging: OSC timeout - fader not receiving responses
- [ ] Waiting for: User to check connection settings and OSC receive patterns
- [ ] Next: Fix connection issue, then test return track discovery

## Implementation Status
- Phase: 1 - Core Implementation
- Step: Testing basic return track control
- Status: BLOCKED - Debugging connection issue

## Test Scripts Created
1. **return_track_test_fader.lua v1.0.1**
   - Auto-discovers Return Track A
   - Extensive logging
   - Double-tap to retry discovery
   - **Issue**: Timeout - no OSC responses received

2. **connection_test.lua v1.0.0**
   - Tests connections 1-10 sequentially
   - Tap to cycle through connections
   - Shows which connection receives responses

3. **simple_return_test.lua v1.0.0**
   - Direct control without discovery
   - Assumes Return A at index 6
   - No waiting for responses

## User Log Shows
```
09:54:41.366 | Script version 1.0.0 loaded
09:54:41.367 | Sending OSC: /live/song/get/num_tracks (connection 1)
09:54:43.368 | WARNING: Query timeout - no response from Ableton
```

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Check OSC Receive Patterns** in TouchOSC Editor:
   - `/live/song/get/num_tracks`
   - `/live/track/get/name`
   - `/live/track/get/volume`
   - `/live/track/volume`

2. **Test Connection Index**:
   - Use connection_test.lua to find working connection
   - Check configuration object for correct settings

3. **Verify AbletonOSC**:
   - Ensure AbletonOSC is running in Ableton
   - Check Ableton preferences for OSC settings

## Feature: Add Send/Return Track Control
Enable control of Ableton's send/return tracks in addition to regular audio/MIDI tracks.

### Phase 0 Complete ✅
- [x] 0.1 Research & Documentation
- [x] 0.2 Test Script Development
- [x] 0.3 Source Code Analysis - CONFIRMED: Extended indexing approach

### Source Code Analysis Results
1. **AbletonOSC DOES support return tracks**
   - Track API explicitly mentions "audio, MIDI, return or master track"
   - APIs exist: `/live/song/create_return_track` and `/live/song/delete_return_track`
   
2. **Return tracks use extended indexing**
   - Same `/live/track/` commands as regular tracks
   - Indices continue after regular tracks
   - Example: 6 regular tracks (0-5), 2 returns (6-7), master (8)

3. **Identification methods**
   - Track names often contain "Return"
   - Missing certain properties (input_routing_channel)
   - Position in track list (after regular, before master)

### Phase 1 In Progress
- [x] Created test scripts
- [ ] Debugging connection/routing issue
- [ ] Waiting for user to verify OSC settings
- [ ] Next: Test return track discovery once connection works

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Created | Tested | Issue | Resolution |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------|------------|
| return_track_test_fader.lua v1.0.1 | ✅ | ❌ | OSC timeout | Pending |
| connection_test.lua v1.0.0 | ✅ | ⏳ | - | Testing |
| simple_return_test.lua v1.0.0 | ✅ | ⏳ | - | Testing |

## Documentation Created
- `docs/return-tracks-analysis.md` - Initial research findings
- `docs/return-tracks-implementation-plan.md` - Technical implementation approach
- `docs/return-tracks-phases.md` - Comprehensive 7-phase implementation plan

## Scripts Created
- `return_track_test.py` - Discovery script (no longer needed)
- TouchOSC test functions - For manual testing if needed

## Next Immediate Actions
1. **User needs to:**
   - Check OSC receive patterns are set in TouchOSC editor
   - Run connection_test.lua to find working connection
   - Verify AbletonOSC is running

2. **Once connection works:**
   - Test return track discovery
   - Verify volume control works
   - Move to implementing in group_init.lua

## User Context
User wants to control send/return tracks in Ableton. Created test scripts but hit connection issue - fader sends OSC but receives no responses.

## Key Code Insights
- Return tracks are part of the standard track list
- No separate `/live/return/` namespace (unlike old LiveOSC)
- All track commands work on return tracks
- Track indices are continuous: regular → return → master

## Thread Handoff Notes
- Test scripts created but blocked by connection issue
- Need user to verify OSC setup
- Once connection works, can proceed with discovery testing
- Implementation approach confirmed: extended indexing
