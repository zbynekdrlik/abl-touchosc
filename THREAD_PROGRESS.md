# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ BLOCKING ISSUES - NOT READY TO MERGE**
- [ ] Currently working on: Testing return track label display (A-, B- prefix removal)
- [ ] Waiting for: Performance optimization - production tablet very laggy
- [ ] Blocked by: Need to verify label display and fix performance issues

## Critical Issues Found (2025-07-03)

### Issue 1: Return Track Label Display
- **Status**: NEEDS TESTING
- **Problem**: Need to verify A-, B- prefix is correctly removed
- **Expected**: "A-Reverb" should display as "Reverb"
- **Test needed**: Create return tracks with various names and verify display

### Issue 2: Performance Problem
- **Status**: CRITICAL - BLOCKING
- **Problem**: TouchOSC very laggy on production tablet
- **Symptoms**: Slow reaction time, poor responsiveness
- **Impact**: Unusable in live performance
- **Investigation needed**:
  - Profile script execution time
  - Check for excessive OSC messages
  - Review smoothing algorithm efficiency
  - Test with different numbers of tracks

## Implementation Status
- Phase: TESTING & OPTIMIZATION
- Step: Performance investigation and label verification
- Status: ⚠️ Blocked by performance issues

## Testing Status Matrix
| Component | Implemented | Unit Tested | Integration Tested | Performance Tested | 
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Group Init v1.14.5 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Fader Script v2.4.1 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Meter Script v2.3.1 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

| db_label.lua v1.2.0 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

## Performance Optimization Areas to Investigate

### 1. Fader Script Smoothing
- Current: 100Hz update rate with smoothing
- Check: Is smoothing algorithm too heavy?
- Test: Reduce update frequency or simplify algorithm

### 2. OSC Message Frequency
- Check: Are we sending too many messages?
- Look for: Message loops or redundant updates
- Test: Add rate limiting

### 3. Meter Updates
- Current: Real-time meter updates
- Check: Update frequency
- Test: Reduce meter refresh rate

### 4. Multiple Script Instances
- Check: Memory usage with many tracks
- Look for: Memory leaks or inefficient storage
- Test: Performance with 8, 16, 32 tracks

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Label Display Testing
```lua
-- Test these return track names:
-- "A-Reverb" → should display "Reverb"
-- "B-Delay Bus" → should display "Delay"
-- "C-FX" → should display "FX"
-- "Return Track" → should display "Return"
```

### 2. Performance Profiling
- Add timing logs to each script
- Measure update frequency
- Monitor OSC message count
- Test on production hardware

### 3. Quick Fixes to Try
- Reduce fader update rate (100Hz → 30Hz?)
- Disable smoothing temporarily
- Reduce meter updates
- Test with fewer active controls

## Version 1.2.0 Release - ON HOLD

### Blocking Issues:
1. **Label Display**: Must verify return track prefix removal
2. **Performance**: Must fix lag on production tablet

### Cannot Merge Until:
- [ ] Return track labels display correctly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable on production hardware
- [ ] No lag or slow response
- [ ] Smooth fader movement restored

## Documentation Updates Needed

After fixing performance:
- Document any optimization changes
- Add performance tuning guide
- Note hardware requirements
- Update best practices

## Branch Status

- Implementation: Complete
- Documentation: Complete
- Cleanup: Complete
- **Testing: FAILED - Performance issues**
- **Ready for merge: NO**

## Last User Action
- Date/Time: 2025-07-03 20:35
- Action: Reported lag on production tablet
- Result: Identified critical performance issue
- Next Required: Performance profiling and optimization

## Critical Path Forward

1. **Save current state** ✓
2. **Test label display** with actual return tracks
3. **Profile performance** on production hardware
4. **Identify bottlenecks**
5. **Implement optimizations**
6. **Re-test on production tablet**
7. **Only merge when performance is acceptable**

⚠️ **DO NOT MERGE** until performance issues are resolved!
