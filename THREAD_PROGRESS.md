# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**⚠️ PR #26 IN PROGRESS:**
- [ ] Currently working on: Fix duplicate track names calls during refresh
- [ ] Waiting for: User testing of centralized track names retrieval
- [ ] Blocked by: None

## ACTIVE WORK: DUPLICATE TRACK NAMES FIX
### Problem Identified:
- Each track group independently calls `/live/song/get/track_names`
- Causes duplicate OSC packets during refresh
- Creates unnecessary network traffic

### Solution Implemented:
1. **Centralized Queries**: ✅
   - Document script queries track names once per connection
   - Caches results in `trackNamesCache`
   - Distributes to all groups via notification

2. **Updated Scripts**: ✅
   - `document_script.lua` v2.10.0 - Centralized querying
   - `group_init.lua` v1.17.0 - Receives names via notification

3. **Testing Required**: ❌
   - [ ] Verify only one track names query per connection
   - [ ] Test all track groups map correctly
   - [ ] Test with multiple connections
   - [ ] Test with both regular and return tracks

## COMPLETED WORK: DOUBLE-CLICK MUTE (PR #24)
### Final Status: READY FOR MERGE
- [x] Double-click mute protection COMPLETE AND WORKING
- [x] Documentation cleanup COMPLETE
- [x] Experimental files removed
- [x] README fully documented with two-control approach
- [x] CHANGELOG finalized for v1.5.0
- [x] Ready for merge
