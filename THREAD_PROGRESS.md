# Thread Progress Tracking

## CRITICAL CURRENT STATE
**‚ö†Ô∏è EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW:**
- [x] Fixed AbletonOSC fork - listeners now fully implemented!
- [x] Group init script v1.14.3 working perfectly
- [x] Status indicators turn GREEN for both track types
- [ ] Need user to reinstall AbletonOSC and test listeners
- [ ] Ready to update child scripts after confirmation

## Major Update: Fixed AbletonOSC Fork!

### What I Fixed in AbletonOSC:
1. **Added dedicated return track listener methods** that send responses to correct OSC paths
2. **Fixed response addresses** - now uses `/live/return/get/*` instead of `/live/track/get/*`
3. **Separated listener keys** to avoid conflicts between regular and return tracks
4. **Full implementation** of all return track listeners (volume, pan, mute, meter, etc.)

### Next Steps for User:
1. **Pull latest changes** from https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC (feature/return-tracks-support branch)
2. **Reinstall AbletonOSC** in Ableton
3. **Restart Ableton Live**
4. **Test return track listeners** - they should work without "Observer not connected" errors!

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
1. **Visual feedback** - Status indicators turn green when mapped
2. **Track detection** - Both regular and return tracks detected correctly
3. **Track mapping** - Both types map to correct indices
4. **AbletonOSC fork** - Now has full return track support with listeners!

### üîß Needs Testing:
1. **Return track listeners** - Should now work after AbletonOSC update
2. **Real-time updates** - Faders/meters should update when changed in Ableton

## Implementation Status
- Phase: ABLETONOSC FIXED - READY FOR CHILD SCRIPT UPDATES
- Step: Waiting for user to test updated AbletonOSC
- Status: Core functionality complete, listeners fixed

## Code Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:
1. **group_init.lua v1.14.3** - Fully working
2. **AbletonOSC fork** - Return track listeners implemented

### üîß Next After Testing:
1. Update child scripts for return track support
2. Remove old return track implementation
3. Update documentation

## Summary
I've successfully fixed the AbletonOSC fork to properly support return track listeners. The "Observer not connected" errors should be gone once you update your AbletonOSC installation. After confirming this works, we can proceed with updating the child scripts.
