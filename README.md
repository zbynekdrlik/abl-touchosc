## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- TouchOSC (latest version)
- Ableton Live with AbletonOSC installed
  - **Important**: Use the [forked version](https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC) for return track support and listener fixes
- Network connections configured in TouchOSC

### Installation

1. **Install the forked AbletonOSC** (required for proper operation):
   - Download from: https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC
   - This fork includes:
     - Return track support
     - Listener cross-wiring fixes (prevents track 5‚Üí5,6,7 and track 8‚Üí10 issues)
     - Thread-safe listener registration
   - Replace your existing AbletonOSC installation
   - Restart Ableton Live

2. **Download the TouchOSC template** from the [releases page](https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/abl-touchosc/releases)

3. **Import into TouchOSC** via the editor

4. **Configure your connections** in the configuration text control:

```yaml
# Connection mapping
connection_band: 2      # Band controls ‚Üí Ableton instance on connection 2
connection_master: 3    # Master controls ‚Üí Ableton instance on connection 3

# Auto-unfold groups
unfold_band: 'Band'     # Unfold 'Band' group in band instance
unfold_master: 'Master' # Unfold 'Master' group in master instance

# Double-click mute protection (optional)
# IMPORTANT: Each group needs its own line!
double_click_mute_band: 'Band Tracks'    # Require double-click for 'Band Tracks' group
double_click_mute_master: 'Master Bus'   # Require double-click for 'Master Bus' group
```

5. **Run the template** - tracks will be discovered automatically after 1 second!

## üìñ User Guide

### Control Layout

Each track group contains:
- **Track Label**: Shows track name (first word, smart prefix handling)
- **Status Indicator**: Green when mapped, red when unmapped
- **Volume Fader**: Professional fader with dB scaling
- **dB Display**: Current volume in dB with color indication
- **Level Meter**: Real-time level display with peak colors
- **Mute Button**: Toggle track mute (with optional double-click protection)
- **Pan Control**: Stereo positioning

### Double-Click Mute Protection (NEW)

For critical tracks where accidental muting could be disastrous (like master bus or live performance tracks), you can enable double-click protection:

1. **Add configuration** for the groups that need protection:
   ```yaml
   # IMPORTANT: Each group needs its own line in the configuration!
   # Each configuration is instance-specific
   
   # Band instance protection (one group per line)
   double_click_mute_band: 'Band Tracks'      # Line 1: Band instance, 'Band Tracks' group
   double_click_mute_band: 'Lead Vocals'      # Line 2: Band instance, 'Lead Vocals' group
   
   # Master instance protection
   double_click_mute_master: 'Master Bus'     # Line 3: Master instance, 'Master Bus' group
   ```

2. **Groups with double-click enabled** require two clicks within 500ms to toggle mute

3. **Groups without configuration** maintain single-click behavior (backward compatible)

### Return Track Setup

Return tracks use the exact same scripts and controls as regular tracks:

1. **Name your group** with the exact return track name:
   - Group name: `master_A-Reverb` (for return track "A-Reverb")
   - Group name: `band_B-Delay` (for return track "B-Delay")

2. **The scripts automatically detect** whether it's a regular or return track

3. **Track labels** intelligently display the first word:
   - "A-Reverb" ‚Üí shows "Reverb" (skips the A- prefix)
   - "B-Delay" ‚Üí shows "Delay"
   - "Drums" ‚Üí shows "Drums" (regular tracks unchanged)

### Automatic Features

- **Startup Refresh**: Tracks are discovered automatically 1 second after opening
- **Track Type Detection**: Scripts automatically detect regular vs return tracks
- **Connection Routing**: Controls automatically route to configured connections
- **State Preservation**: Control positions are maintained between sessions
- **Visual Feedback**: All controls provide immediate visual feedback
- **Feedback Loop Prevention**: Faders won't echo back when controlled from Ableton

### Manual Controls

- **Refresh Button**: Manually trigger track discovery at any time
- **Logger**: View system messages and track assignments

## üîß Configuration

### Basic Configuration

The configuration text control accepts these parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| connection_[instance] | Map instance to connection number | `connection_band: 2` |
| unfold_[instance] | Auto-unfold group name for instance | `unfold_band: 'Band'` |
| unfold | Legacy: unfold on all connections | `unfold: 'Drums'` |
| double_click_mute_[instance] | Require double-click for group (one per line) | `double_click_mute_band: 'Band Tracks'` |

### Configuration Format Rules

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Each configuration entry must be on its own line!

‚úÖ **CORRECT** - Each group on separate line:
```yaml
double_click_mute_band: 'Drums'
double_click_mute_band: 'Bass'
double_click_mute_band: 'Lead Vocal'
```

‚ùå **INCORRECT** - Multiple groups on one line (will NOT work):
```yaml
double_click_mute_band: 'Drums', 'Bass', 'Lead Vocal'  # This won't work!
```

### Multi-Instance Example

```yaml
# Two separate connections
connection_band: 2      # Band mix Ableton
connection_master: 3    # Master mix Ableton

# Different unfold groups per instance  
unfold_band: 'Band'
unfold_master: 'Master'

# Double-click protection for critical tracks
# Each group needs its own line!
double_click_mute_band: 'Band Tracks'    # Protect band master group
double_click_mute_band: 'Drums'          # Protect drums
double_click_mute_band: 'Lead Vocal'     # Protect lead vocals
double_click_mute_master: 'Master Bus'   # Protect master bus
double_click_mute_master: 'Limiter'      # Protect final limiter
```

### Complete Multi-Instance Configuration Example

```yaml
# Four Ableton instances for live show
connection_band: 2
connection_playback: 3
connection_fx: 4
connection_broadcast: 5

# Auto-unfold groups
unfold_band: 'Rhythm Section'
unfold_band: 'Vocals'              # Yes, you can have multiple unfolds per instance
unfold_playback: 'Backing Tracks'
unfold_fx: 'Send Effects'
unfold_broadcast: 'Stream Mix'

# Double-click protection - Band instance
double_click_mute_band: 'Drums'
double_click_mute_band: 'Bass'
double_click_mute_band: 'Lead Vocal'
double_click_mute_band: 'Click Track'

# Double-click protection - Playback instance
double_click_mute_playback: 'Main Playback'
double_click_mute_playback: 'Timecode'
double_click_mute_playback: 'Video Sync'

# Double-click protection - FX instance
double_click_mute_fx: 'Reverb Send'
double_click_mute_fx: 'Delay Send'

# Double-click protection - Broadcast instance
double_click_mute_broadcast: 'Stream Master'
double_click_mute_broadcast: 'Broadcast Limiter'
```

Both regular tracks and return tracks use the same connection for each instance.

## üìö Technical Documentation

### Architecture Overview

The system uses a unified script architecture:
- **Document Script**: Central configuration and logging
- **Group Scripts**: Track discovery with auto-detection
- **Control Scripts**: Same scripts handle both track types
- **Tag Communication**: Parent groups pass info via tags
- **Complete Isolation**: No shared variables between scripts

### Script Versions

| Script | Current Version | Purpose |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| document_script.lua | 2.9.0 | Configuration, group registry, auto-refresh |
| group_init.lua | 1.16.2 | Track group with auto-detection and registration |
| fader_script.lua | 2.5.4 | Volume control with feedback loop prevention |

- **Unified Scripts**: No code duplication between track types
- **Smart Labels**: Intelligent handling of return track prefixes
- **Frame-based Timing**: Reliable startup refresh using frame counting
- **Direct Configuration Reading**: Each script reads config independently
- **Connection Filtering**: OSC messages filtered by connection
- **State Machine Design**: Robust state tracking for all controls
- **Group Registration**: Groups self-register with document script for reliable refresh
- **Feedback Prevention**: Controls won't echo back when updated from Ableton
- **Double-Click Detection**: Instance-specific timing-based double-click for critical tracks

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Faders jumpy when controlled from Ableton:**
- Update to fader_script.lua v2.5.4 or later
- This version includes feedback loop prevention

**Wrong tracks responding (e.g., Track 8 moves Track 10):**
- Install the [forked AbletonOSC](https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC)
- This is a bug in the original AbletonOSC's listener system
- The fork includes proper thread-safe listener registration

**Return tracks not working:**
- Install the [forked AbletonOSC](https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC)
- Check return track names match exactly (including "A-", "B-" prefixes)
- Look for "Mapped to Return Track X" in logs

**Double-click mute not working:**
- Check each group is on its own line in configuration
- Group name must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Must include instance name (e.g., `double_click_mute_band:` not just `double_click_mute:`)
- Enable DEBUG = 1 in mute_button.lua to see detection logs
- Verify configuration format matches examples exactly

**Controls not responding:**
- Check connection numbers in configuration
- Verify AbletonOSC is running in Ableton
- Press refresh button to re-discover tracks

**Performance issues with many tracks:**
- See [Performance Guide](docs/PERFORMANCE.md) for optimization strategies
- Ensure DEBUG = 0 in all scripts for production use

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by modifying script DEBUG constants:
```lua
local DEBUG = 1  -- Set to 1 for verbose logging
```
