# ABL TouchOSC Control Surface

A professional TouchOSC control surface for Ableton Live with advanced multi-instance routing capabilities and full return track support. Control multiple Ableton Live instances from a single interface with automatic track discovery and professional-grade controls.

## üéØ Key Features

### Multi-Instance Control
- **Selective Connection Routing**: Route different controls to different Ableton instances
- **Automatic Track Discovery**: Tracks are discovered and mapped automatically on startup
- **Dynamic Group Management**: Track groups auto-unfold based on configuration

### Return Track Support (v1.2.0) üéâ
- **Unified Architecture**: Same scripts handle both regular and return tracks
- **Automatic Detection**: Groups automatically detect track type
- **Full Control Suite**: Volume, mute, pan, and metering for return tracks
- **Smart Track Labels**: First word display with return prefix handling
- **Requires**: [Forked AbletonOSC](https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC/tree/feature/return-tracks-support) with listener fixes

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- TouchOSC (latest version)
- Ableton Live with AbletonOSC installed
  - For return track support: Use the [forked version](https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC/tree/feature/return-tracks-support)
- Network connections configured in TouchOSC

### Installation

1. **For Return Track Support** (optional):
   - Download the [forked AbletonOSC](https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC/tree/feature/return-tracks-support)
   - Replace your existing AbletonOSC installation
   - Restart Ableton Live

2. **Download the TouchOSC template** from the releases page

3. **Import into TouchOSC** via the editor

4. **Configure your connections** in the configuration text control:

```yaml
# Connection mapping
connection_band: 2      # Band controls ‚Üí Ableton instance on connection 2
connection_master: 3    # Master controls ‚Üí Ableton instance on connection 3

# Auto-unfold groups
unfold_band: 'Band'     # Unfold 'Band' group in band instance
unfold_master: 'Master' # Unfold 'Master' group in master instance
```

5. **Run the template** - tracks will be discovered automatically after 1 second!

## üìñ User Guide

### Control Layout

Each track group contains:
- **Track Label**: Shows track name (first word, smart prefix handling)
- **Status Indicator**: Green when mapped, red when unmapped
- **Volume Fader**: Professional fader with dB scaling
- **dB Display**: Current volume in dB
- **Level Meter**: Real-time level display with peak colors
- **Mute Button**: Toggle track mute
- **Pan Control**: Stereo positioning

### Return Track Setup

Return tracks use the exact same scripts and controls as regular tracks:

1. **Name your group** with the exact return track name:
   - Group name: `master_A-Reverb` (for return track "A-Reverb")
   - Group name: `band_B-Delay` (for return track "B-Delay")

2. **The scripts automatically detect** whether it's a regular or return track

3. **Track labels** intelligently display the first word:
   - "A-Reverb" ‚Üí shows "Reverb" (skips the A- prefix)
   - "B-Delay" ‚Üí shows "Delay"
   - "Drums" ‚Üí shows "Drums" (regular tracks unchanged)

### Automatic Features

- **Startup Refresh**: Tracks are discovered automatically 1 second after opening
- **Track Type Detection**: Scripts automatically detect regular vs return tracks
- **Connection Routing**: Controls automatically route to configured connections
- **State Preservation**: Control positions are maintained between sessions
- **Visual Feedback**: All controls provide immediate visual feedback

### Manual Controls

- **Refresh Button**: Manually trigger track discovery at any time
- **Logger**: View system messages and track assignments

## üîß Configuration

### Basic Configuration

The configuration text control accepts these parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| connection_[instance] | Map instance to connection number | `connection_band: 2` |
| unfold_[instance] | Auto-unfold group name for instance | `unfold_band: 'Band'` |
| unfold | Legacy: unfold on all connections | `unfold: 'Drums'` |

### Multi-Instance Example

```yaml
# Two separate connections
connection_band: 2      # Band mix Ableton
connection_master: 3    # Master mix Ableton

# Different unfold groups per instance  
unfold_band: 'Band'
unfold_master: 'Master'
```

Both regular tracks and return tracks use the same connection for each instance.

## üìö Technical Documentation

### Architecture Overview

The system uses a unified script architecture:
- **Document Script**: Central configuration and logging
- **Group Scripts**: Track discovery with auto-detection
- **Control Scripts**: Same scripts handle both track types
- **Tag Communication**: Parent groups pass info via tags
- **Complete Isolation**: No shared variables between scripts

### Script Versions

| Script | Current Version | Purpose |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| document_script.lua | 2.7.1 | Configuration, logging, auto-refresh |
| group_init.lua | 1.14.5 | Track group with auto-detection |
| fader_script.lua | 2.4.1 | Volume control for all track types |
| meter_script.lua | 2.3.1 | Level metering unified |
| mute_button.lua | 1.9.1 | Mute control unified |
| pan_control.lua | 1.4.1 | Pan control unified |
| db_label.lua | 1.2.0 | dB display unified |
| db_meter_label.lua | 2.5.1 | Peak meter unified |
| global_refresh_button.lua | 1.4.0 | Manual refresh trigger |

### Unified Architecture Details

Groups communicate track information through tags:
```lua
-- Tag format: "instance:trackNumber:trackType"
self.tag = "master:0:return"  -- Return track 0 on master
self.tag = "band:5:track"     -- Regular track 5 on band
```

Child scripts parse the parent tag to determine:
- Which track number to control
- Whether to use `/live/track/` or `/live/return/` OSC paths
- Which connection to use for routing

### Return Track OSC Messages

The forked AbletonOSC adds these endpoints:

**Query Messages:**
- `/live/song/get/num_return_tracks` - Get return track count
- `/live/song/get/return_track_names` - Get return track names
- `/live/song/get/return_track_data` - Get detailed return data

**Control Messages:**
- `/live/return/get/[property] [index]` - Get return track property
- `/live/return/set/[property] [index] [value]` - Set return track property
- `/live/return/start_listen/[property] [index]` - Start property listener
- `/live/return/stop_listen/[property] [index]` - Stop property listener

### Key Technical Features

- **Auto-Detection**: Groups query both track types and map appropriately
- **Unified Scripts**: No code duplication between track types
- **Smart Labels**: Intelligent handling of return track prefixes
- **Frame-based Timing**: Reliable startup refresh using frame counting
- **Direct Configuration Reading**: Each script reads config independently
- **Connection Filtering**: OSC messages filtered by connection
- **State Machine Design**: Robust state tracking for all controls

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Return tracks not working:**
- Install the [forked AbletonOSC](https://github.com/zbynekdrlik/AbletonOSC/tree/feature/return-tracks-support)
- Check return track names match exactly (including "A-", "B-" prefixes)
- Look for "Mapped to Return Track X" in logs

**Controls not responding:**
- Check connection numbers in configuration
- Verify AbletonOSC is running in Ableton
- Press refresh button to re-discover tracks

**Wrong tracks mapped:**
- Ensure exact name matching for groups
- Check both regular and return track names
- Try manual refresh

**Track label shows wrong text:**
- Update to group_init.lua v1.14.5 or later
- Script now handles return prefixes intelligently

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by modifying script DEBUG constants:
```lua
local DEBUG = 1  -- Set to 1 for verbose logging
```
