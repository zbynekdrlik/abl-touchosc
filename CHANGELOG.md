- **Automatic Startup Refresh**: Tracks discovered automatically after 1 second
- **Professional Controls**: All core track controls implemented
  - Volume Fader with 0.1dB precision and double-tap to 0dB
  - Calibrated Level Meter with color thresholds
  - Mute Button with state tracking
  - Pan Control with double-tap to center
  - dB Value Display
- **Visual Design Preservation**: Scripts never alter your interface design
- **Complete Script Isolation**: Robust architecture with isolated components
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Production-ready documentation

- Track discovery functional

## Key Technical Achievements

### Multi-Connection Architecture
Successfully implemented routing to control multiple Ableton instances from one TouchOSC interface with complete isolation.

### Automatic Startup Refresh
Implemented automatic track discovery on TouchOSC startup, eliminating manual refresh requirement.

### Script Isolation
Discovered and solved TouchOSC script isolation challenges, leading to robust architecture.

### State Preservation
Implemented principle that controls never change position based on assumptions.

## Future Roadmap

### Planned Enhancements
- Additional track groups for full production scaling
- Solo and record arm controls
- Send level controls (A-D)
- Device parameter mapping
- Scene launching capabilities
- Debug level system for logging
