# Implementation Progress

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

### Completed Features

#### Phase 0: Infrastructure ✅
- **Helper Script (v1.0.9)**
  - Configuration parsing from text object
  - Visual logger with timestamp
  - Connection routing helpers
  - Global refresh function
  - OSC passthrough to prevent blocking

#### Phase 1: Group Implementation ✅
- **Group Script (v1.5.1)**
  - Connection-aware track mapping
  - Safety features (disable when unmapped)
  - Exact name matching only
  - Visual status indicators
  - Global refresh support
  
- **Global Refresh Button (v1.1.0)**
  - Single button refreshes all groups
  - Visual feedback during refresh
  - Status display support

### Key Technical Achievements

#### 1. Script Communication
- Solved script isolation with notify() system
- Parent-child data sharing via properties
- Global functions via helper script

#### 2. OSC Routing
- Proper sendOSC syntax with connection tables
- OSC receive pattern configuration (UI only)
- Message filtering by connection
- Proper return values in callbacks

#### 3. Safety Features
- Controls disabled when not mapped
- Track numbers cleared on refresh
- Exact name matching enforcement
- Visual feedback for all states

#### 4. User Experience
- Single global refresh button
- Clear visual status indicators
- Optional visual logger
- Consistent color coding

### Current Script Versions
- `helper_script.lua`: v1.0.9
- `group_init.lua`: v1.5.1
- `global_refresh_button.lua`: v1.1.0
- `fader_script.lua`: Original (needs update)
- `meter_script.lua`: Original (needs update)

### Known Issues Resolved
1. ✅ Scripts cannot share variables → notify() system
2. ✅ OSC not reaching groups → proper routing setup
3. ✅ Color assignment errors → Color() constructor
4. ✅ Wrong track control → exact matching + disable
5. ✅ Poor UX with many refresh buttons → global refresh

### Testing Results
- ✅ Single group maps correctly
- ✅ Refresh recovers from track reordering
- ✅ Controls disable when track not found
- ✅ Visual feedback working
- ✅ Logger functioning properly

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Control Script Updates
- [ ] Update fader_script.lua for connection awareness
- [ ] Update meter_script.lua for connection filtering
- [ ] Add mute button connection routing
- [ ] Add pan control connection routing

### Phase 3: Production Testing
- [ ] Test with multiple groups
- [ ] Test with both Ableton instances
- [ ] Performance testing with many controls
- [ ] Network failure recovery testing

### Phase 4: Documentation
- [ ] User setup guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Video tutorial
- [ ] Quick reference card

### Phase 5: Deployment
- [ ] Backup existing setup
- [ ] Deploy to primary TouchOSC
- [ ] Deploy to backup devices
- [ ] Monitor for issues

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Phase 1 complete and tested
- **Medium Risk**: Control script updates need careful testing
- **Mitigated**: Safety features prevent wrong track control

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 2: 2-3 hours (control updates)
- Phase 3: 1-2 hours (testing)
- Phase 4: 2-3 hours (documentation)
- Phase 5: 1 hour (deployment)

**Total: 6-9 hours to complete**
