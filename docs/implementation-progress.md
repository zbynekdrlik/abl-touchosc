# Implementation Progress

## Current Status: Phase 2 Complete ✅

### Completed Features

#### Phase 0: Infrastructure ✅
- **Helper Script (v1.0.9)**
  - Configuration parsing from text object
  - Visual logger with timestamp
  - Connection routing helpers
  - Global refresh function
  - OSC passthrough to prevent blocking

#### Phase 1: Group Implementation ✅
- **Group Script (v1.5.1)**
  - Connection-aware track mapping
  - Safety features (disable when unmapped)
  - Exact name matching only
  - Visual status indicators
  - Global refresh support
  
- **Global Refresh Button (v1.1.0)**
  - Single button refreshes all groups
  - Visual feedback during refresh
  - Status display support

#### Phase 2: Control Script Updates ✅
- **Fader Script (v2.0.0)**
  - Connection-aware routing
  - Disables when track not mapped
  - Maintains all existing features
  - Routes OSC to correct connection
  
- **Meter Script (v2.0.0)**
  - Connection filtering for incoming messages
  - Visual dimming when track not mapped
  - Calibrated display with color coding
  
- **Mute Button (v1.0.0)**
  - Connection-aware toggle control
  - Visual feedback (red when muted)
  - Disabled appearance when unmapped
  
- **Pan Control (v1.0.0)**
  - Connection-aware pan adjustment
  - Center detent feature
  - Sync after touch release

### Key Technical Achievements

#### 1. Script Communication
- Solved script isolation with notify() system
- Parent-child data sharing via properties
- Global functions via helper script

#### 2. OSC Routing
- Proper sendOSC syntax with connection tables
- OSC receive pattern configuration (UI only)
- Message filtering by connection
- Proper return values in callbacks

#### 3. Safety Features
- Controls disabled when not mapped
- Track numbers cleared on refresh
- Exact name matching enforcement
- Visual feedback for all states

#### 4. User Experience
- Single global refresh button
- Clear visual status indicators
- Optional visual logger
- Consistent color coding
- Controls disable when track not found

### Current Script Versions
- `helper_script.lua`: v1.0.9
- `group_init.lua`: v1.5.1
- `global_refresh_button.lua`: v1.1.0
- `fader_script.lua`: v2.0.0 ✅
- `meter_script.lua`: v2.0.0 ✅
- `mute_button.lua`: v1.0.0 ✅
- `pan_control.lua`: v1.0.0 ✅

### Known Issues Resolved
1. ✅ Scripts cannot share variables → notify() system
2. ✅ OSC not reaching groups → proper routing setup
3. ✅ Color assignment errors → Color() constructor
4. ✅ Wrong track control → exact matching + disable
5. ✅ Poor UX with many refresh buttons → global refresh

### Testing Results
- ✅ Single group maps correctly
- ✅ Refresh recovers from track reordering
- ✅ Controls disable when track not found
- ✅ Visual feedback working
- ✅ Logger functioning properly
- ✅ All control types updated for connection awareness

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Production Testing
- [ ] Test with multiple groups (10+ tracks)
- [ ] Test with both Ableton instances simultaneously
- [ ] Performance testing with many controls
- [ ] Network failure recovery testing
- [ ] Extended session stability testing

### Phase 4: Documentation
- [ ] User setup guide with screenshots
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide with common issues
- [ ] Video tutorial for setup process
- [ ] Quick reference card for controls

### Phase 5: Deployment
- [ ] Backup existing TouchOSC setup
- [ ] Deploy to primary TouchOSC device
- [ ] Deploy to backup devices
- [ ] Monitor for issues in production
- [ ] Gather user feedback

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Phase 1 & 2 complete and tested
- **Medium Risk**: Production load testing needed
- **Mitigated**: Safety features prevent wrong track control

## Timeline Estimate
- Phase 3: 1-2 hours (testing)
- Phase 4: 2-3 hours (documentation)
- Phase 5: 1 hour (deployment)

**Total: 4-6 hours to production**

## Phase 2 Summary
Phase 2 has been successfully completed with all control scripts updated to be connection-aware. The system now:
- Routes fader movements to the correct Ableton instance
- Filters incoming meter data by connection
- Disables controls when tracks are not mapped
- Provides clear visual feedback for all states
- Maintains all existing functionality while adding safety

The foundation is now complete for selective connection routing!
