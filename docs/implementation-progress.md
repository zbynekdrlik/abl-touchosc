# Implementation Progress

## Phase 01: Selective Connection Routing

### Version History
- **v1.0.0** (2025-06-27): Initial Phase 0 implementation - Helper script with version logging

### Completed Steps

#### Phase 0: Preparation and Testing Setup âœ…
1. Created feature branch: `feature/selective-connection-routing`
2. Created PR #5 for tracking changes
3. Added `helper_script.lua` with:
   - Version logging on startup (v1.0.0)
   - Configuration validation
   - Connection routing helpers
   - Status color definitions
   - Refresh function foundations

### Manual Setup Required
Before testing, you need to:
1. Add the `helper_script.lua` to your TouchOSC document root
2. Create configuration text objects:
   - Name: `connection_band`, Text: `1`
   - Name: `connection_master`, Text: `2`
3. Configure your connections:
   - Connection 1: Band Ableton instance
   - Connection 2: Master Ableton instance

### Testing Checklist for Phase 0
