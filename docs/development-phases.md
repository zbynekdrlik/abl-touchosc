# ABL TouchOSC Development Phases

## Phase Overview

This document tracks the development phases of the ABL TouchOSC control surface project, documenting completed work and planning future improvements.

---

## âœ… Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)

### Goals
- Establish basic OSC communication
- Create configuration system
- Implement track discovery

### Deliverables
- Helper script with configuration parsing
- Basic group scripts for track mapping
- Initial control scripts (fader, meter)
- Logger integration

### Key Decisions
- Document script pattern for centralized management
- Configuration text control for easy editing
- Group-based track organization

---

## âœ… Phase 2: Multi-Connection Architecture (Complete)

### Goals
- Enable control of multiple Ableton instances
- Implement connection routing
- Instance-specific track management

### Deliverables
- Connection routing in all scripts
- Instance-based configuration (connection_band, connection_master)
- Per-instance unfold groups
- Tag format update (instance:track)

### Key Architecture
```
TouchOSC
â”œâ”€â”€ Band Controls â†’ Connection 2 â†’ Ableton Band
â””â”€â”€ Master Controls â†’ Connection 3 â†’ Ableton Master
```

### Technical Implementation
- Connection table routing
- Direct config reading in each script
- Instance detection from parent tags

---

## âœ… Phase 3: Control Implementation (Complete)

### Goals
- Implement all core track controls
- Ensure multi-connection isolation
- Professional-grade functionality

### Deliverables

#### Fader Script (v2.3.5)
- Sophisticated movement scaling
- 0.1dB minimum movement
- Double-tap to 0dB
- Emergency movement detection
- State preservation (no assumptions)

#### Meter Script (v2.2.2)
- Exact calibration matching Ableton
- Color thresholds (green/yellow/red)
- Connection-specific response
- Smooth color transitions

#### Mute Button (v1.8.0)
- State tracking with feedback prevention
- Visual state only (no text)
- Touch detection
- Unified logging

#### Pan Control (v1.3.2)
- Simple, clean implementation
- Double-tap to center
- Visual color feedback
- Connection routing

#### Group Script (v1.9.6)
- No visual corruption
- Track label management
- Status indicators
- Control enabling/disabling

### Key Learnings Applied
- Scripts are completely isolated
- Never change control positions on assumptions
- Buttons don't have text property
- Each script reads config directly
- Preserve user's visual design

## ðŸš§ Phase 4: Production Scaling (Next)

### Goals
- Scale to full production setup
- Optimize performance
- Complete testing

### Planned Deliverables
- 8 band track groups
- 8 master track groups
- Performance optimization
- Load testing with 100+ tracks
- Memory usage optimization

### Implementation Plan
1. Duplicate band_CG # group 7 times
2. Create master groups with connection 3
3. Test cross-connection isolation
4. Verify performance with full project

---

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 5: Logging Optimization (Planned)

### Goals
- Reduce log verbosity
- Implement debug levels
- Clean production output

### Planned Features

#### Debug Levels
```lua
local DEBUG = 0  -- 0=production, 1=verbose

local function debugLog(message)
    if DEBUG == 1 then
        log("[DEBUG] " .. message)
    end
end
```

#### Concise Logging
- One-line script initialization
- User actions only in production
- Technical details in debug mode
- Performance metrics

#### Example Clean Output
```
05:24:08 === NEW SESSION 2025-06-29 ===
05:24:08 Document Script v2.7.0 ready
05:24:08 Config: 2 connections, 3 unfolds
05:24:08 FADER(band_CG #) v2.4.0 ready
05:24:13 === GLOBAL REFRESH ===
05:24:14 CONTROL(band_CG #) Mapped to Track 39
05:24:53 MUTE(band_CG #): Sent mute ON
```

### Implementation Strategy
1. Add DEBUG constant to all scripts
2. Move verbose logs to debugLog()
3. Consolidate initialization messages
4. Add performance timing logs

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 6: Advanced Controls (Planned)

### Goals
- Add remaining track controls
- Implement send controls
- Device parameter mapping

### Planned Controls

#### Track Controls
- Solo buttons with exclusive/non-exclusive modes
- Record arm buttons
- Track selection
- Track color synchronization

#### Send Controls
- Send level faders (A-D)
- Send on/off buttons
- Send pan controls
- Pre/post fader switching

#### Device Controls
- Device selection
- Parameter banks
- Macro controls
- Device on/off

### Technical Challenges
- Device parameter discovery
- Bank management
- Parameter value scaling
- Visual feedback design
